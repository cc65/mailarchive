&gt; &gt; well.... i dont pretty much agree with you... there is actually NO
&gt; &gt; difference
&gt; &gt; in using PRG, SEQ, USR, REL or whatever files, since direct raw access
&gt; &gt; worx
&gt; &gt; with all of these in the same way. also lseek() and stuff aint a real
&gt; &gt; problem
&gt; &gt; since we could use a thing simelar to what 'crackers' refer to as IFFL.
&gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; would probably work without having to seek through the whole file, since
&gt; &gt; it'll
&gt; &gt; work on a 254-bytes block basis, and also the last readen block could be
&gt; &gt; buffered (in the drive). i know that would still cause some problems if
&gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; would be lseek()'ing like a mad dog, but it'll still work (however)
&gt; &gt; the other problem (opening several files at once for reading and
&gt; &gt; writing) may
&gt; &gt; be a harder thing to solve, but keeping the above mentioned technique in
&gt; &gt; mind,
&gt; &gt; it will still be possible with a clever drive-code.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems you know more about this than I. Maybe you can elaborate this a bit,
&gt; so we can find a possible technical solution. If we have one, the only thing
&gt; left is to find someone who writes the code:-)

well honestly... after over 15 years hacking the c64, i guess there's
not
much left on that topic that i dont understand 8=)

i will just leech the latest compiler now and then have a look how much
work it'll be to write something like that =)

&gt; The C standard says nothing about the signedness of chars. Both signed and
&gt; unsigned chars are allowed. Traditionally, PC compilers tend to use signed
&gt; chars, while Unix compilers often have unsigned chars. The choice to use
&gt; unsigned characters for cc65 does not only give better code, but it is in full
&gt; compliance with the ISO C standard. Programs that depend on the signedness of
&gt; chars are non portable.
&gt; 
&gt; If you need a specific character type (signed or unsigned), declare it as
&gt; such. If you don't specify the signedness explicitly, the compiler is free to
&gt; choose.
&gt; 
&gt;     signed char sc;     /* A signed character */
&gt;     unsigned char uc;   /* An unsigned character */
&gt;     char c;             /* Signedness depends on the implementation */

aaaah, ok... sorry then, i thought the signed/unsigned keyword isnt
available 
at all (that is, i ALWAYS declare my stuff as signed/unsigned)

&gt; &gt; Also i noticed that you mention the INT datatype in
&gt; &gt; quite some places of the docs, and since you seem to be one of the ppl
&gt; &gt; that like to &quot;follow the rulez&quot; i just wanted to point out that INT is
&gt; &gt; by far
&gt; &gt; not standard, and lots of literature  (ehrm orthograpy sux =)  advices
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; no more use it, at least not for portable code (use short/u_short
&gt; &gt; instead
&gt; &gt; for example)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure what you're refering to. I don't remember mentioning a datatype
&gt; named INT in the docs, and a
&gt; 
&gt;         grep INT *
&gt; 
&gt; in the doc directory shows no match. If you're talking about int (as opposed
&gt; to INT), this is a standard datatype with well defined semantics. I don't see
&gt; any problems with portability when using ints.

yeah... ofcoz i ment int... and well, i have read quite some stuff about
C
lately, and i remember that there were certain problems with int and it
should be replaced by some other datatype. i think the major problem
was,
that the amount of bits in an int is not defined (in opossite to
short/long)
so you may get some probs when porting the code.
 
&gt; &gt; however, i have noticed there is now
&gt; &gt; also a
&gt; &gt; MAKE-utility for cc65, so i guess that should be no prob now doing that
&gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; more sourcefiles.
&gt; 
&gt; There is no make utility (you may want to consider GNU make if you need one),
&gt; but the cl65 compile and link utility allows the translation of a multi-file
&gt; project with one command.

yeah... thats what i ment =)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; oh, another quick question i was wondering about.... my editor needs to
&gt; &gt; bank out ALL kernal/basic rom and also need access to ram under i/o at
&gt; &gt; certain times... will the runtime library work with that? and, will i
&gt; &gt; need to rewrite lots of the other libs to make them work independent
&gt; &gt; from the roms?! or would it just compile and WORK? 8=) (that'll be very
&gt; &gt; nice really hehe)
&gt; 
&gt; The compiler generated code, the runtime library and the standard C library do
&gt; not depend on any ROM code. The startup code uses kernal calls, as well as the
&gt; conio module. Most other C64 specific routines do not call the kernal. The
&gt; BASIC ROM is never used, in fact, it's banked out in the standard
&gt; configuration.

ok.... seems to work for me then =) i need a custom conio anyway
(keyboard-
scanner that can detect several keys pressed at once) so guess that wont
be
a problem...

whatever.... gotta play around with the new compiler now i guess =)
