Thanks for the info; drop me email if you get too many emails (like this one) from
'funs', will stop writing. [No problem]

Anywayz, will download your compiler for testing. Send you some cash later on as
well (not as a payment; but for supporting your project for C64).

Started coding prog for handling FIFOs and STATIC 2 X 8KB RAM for buffer (double).
Just a HOPE. Works somehow. Next problem to deal with is the pc's BIOS; tries to
boot from floppy and uses own CRT... etc. will start dealing with it next or
following week.  If you don't mind, will send you some photos 'bout the system
(yeah, later on; have to save some money for a good CCD-cam).

BTW: It's cheap to manufacturer it. Give you one system, you will sell others on
your site? (low price)

Failed to get 65816! I WAS told that someone manufactures it, but failed to find
it. (Sure, MOS doesn't exist or Rockwell's series). 8088's still doing fine (old
board).
Bought 2 X Z80 from old East-Block country (in fact from Finland; though they were
imported, something like from Cezh... Slovakia, anywayz... let me know how to spell
it....), only USD 1 ea.! If you fool around with HW, let me know, will (postal)
mail you one of them, for hobby (Z80A, 4MHz, plastic case; difficult to overclock;
melts... managed 5MHz for 16 hours w/ pc's supercooler, stayed stable, Hitachi has
(or used to have) a 16bit z80 compatible cpu in ceramic DIL (DIP?) casing..., just
USD 25).

Sure C64 and so are your hobby; pls. let me know what are you doing for your living
(job).

BTW:
You have no-one dealing w/ math library (float, etc.)? Could try to figure out
something, though promise nothing.... Won't help you w/ programming, but might send
you 6502 libraries or translated 8086-code (6502 compatible) for it, let me check
out my HDs, should be 'round 9.7GB data.....

Let me know, please.
