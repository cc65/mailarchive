Hyho out there... new versions seem to be coming out faster than i could check
them out lately =) cool work!

I have spent quite some time on using cc65 lately and i have to say that it is
a *really* nice tool! 

&gt;Support for some features is still missing. To name a few:
&gt;
&gt;  * No file routines. Actually, most stdio routines are there, but the
&gt;    low level file I/O is missing, so you get linker errors if you try to
&gt;    use them with files.

However... maybe someone remembers that i talked about writing a filesystem some
(long) time ago, and actually it IS happening! I have already written a lot of
'lowlevel' drive routines (basically wrapper functions to kernal routines) and
i have built a file-system on it, that is already quite comfortable as long as
you
stick with commodore limitations (only one file at a time, no seeking)...

the filesystem is designed to work with different 'sub-systems' (call them
device-
drivers) so native-1541 drivers with fastload,seeking&amp;buffering will be
possible, just as doing a REU driver or supporting some other i/o device.

right now, the aim is to finish the 'driver' for the cbm kernal routines and
some
&quot;stress test&quot; program for the filesystem itself. Once this proved to work the 
kernal 'driver' will be a good template for writing native drivers for whatever
drive.

current things supported are like: (typing this off-hand so some may missing)

init:    fs_init();			 - obvious =)
         fs_mount();                     - mount a subsystem 

stdio:   open();close();read();write();
         eof();
turbo-c: findfirst();findnext();         - directory access
         dosexterr();                    - get extended error info
         getdisk();			 - get current working drive number
non-std: get();                          - get one byte from file (to be called
from fgetc)
         doscommand();			 - send cbm-style dos command

+ a lot low level device-i/o routines (they'll work all the same, regardless
what
device they are mapped to)
+ a handful wrapper functions to kernal-calls. if you are familiar with these,
they
might come in handy aswell ;=)

some other (already working or in-the-making) features are:

- true iso-style path/filenames like

  8:\myfile.txt		(you can alternativly use letters instead of numbers for the
drive)

  - both having several drives and also subdirectories are handled

- decent error handling

long-run planned things:

- support for c64&lt;=&gt;pc link via pc64 cable (i have coded such a thing already
and i think
it'll just come in handy to mount the pc-hd via a link and use it just like any
other 
drive on the c64 =)

mmmmh.... however, if someone of you might have some 1581/1571/CMD specific info
of any kind, let me know.... most of what i am doing in that direction is based
on guesswork ;=P

oh... one other question is, that i looked at the RTL and couldnt find the point
where lseek() would kick in the i/o routines... also, would my open() have to
deal with eg stdout as a parameter?!

talking of standard out.... your printf() should ALWAYS print to screen, no
matter
a file is open or not ;=) took me some time to figure out that some printf sent
garbage to the drive instead of printing info on the screen 8=)) (dont use
$ffd2! :P)

&gt; &gt; Some kind of test suit would be nice, wouldn't it?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but writing a test suite is only one part of the game. The other is, that
&gt; translating and transfering the test suite to the real machines is complex,
&gt; and even using an emulator prohibits the use of batch file or other utilities
&gt; that may help in verifying the program results.
&gt; 
&gt; What I'm currently doing is to use the programs I have written as test
&gt; programs, in the hope, the code will cover most instructions. This assumption
&gt; seems to be wrong, however...

mmmh... actually i have written a little command-line interpreter for testing my
file routines... soon i will have added some kind of 'batchfile' capability as
well and then it will only be a matter of running 2 C-programs at different
memory locations ... i need to dig a bit deeper into the RTL and the compiler 
though (what about that o65 fileformat? would that be a good solution?)

so long.....

gpz

oh...don't ask for the code yet,its a mess,you dont want to have it like this
;=P
as soon as its cleaned up and all standarized, i will post it.
