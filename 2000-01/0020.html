Hi!

&gt; But, with VICE, people most often want to keep the various versions
&gt; 100% compatible with each other, even with the INI files (and so,
&gt; the symbol files, too), so I'm _sure_ they will not want to make
&gt; this modification, especially since it's something generated from
&gt; YACC that complains...
&gt;
&gt; Although I'm not very familiar with YACC, I believe the modification
&gt; of LD is easier than the modification of VICE.

I have worked with the VICE monitor code myself, so I'm pretty sure that the
YACC grammar has nothing to do with line termination. Even if the YACC
grammar would describe full lines, all that is needed is to put the CR
character into the whitespace class in the lexer. But the real solution is
probably even simpler: ld65 would have to add a &quot;b&quot; mode character when
calling fopen(), VICE on the other side would have to drop it, so the
translation CR/LF --&gt; LF is done by the input functions of the C library. As
a result, the VICE code will never have to emit a CR explicitly, and will
never see it, when reading files.

&gt; Well, I asked my question about the debug generations because I want
&gt; to extend the VICE monitor for better debugging.

Ahh! Does that mean that I do not have to bug Daniel requesting new
monitor features, but send my mails to you instead? :-)

Do you know if the fast breakpoint check is now implemented in VICE? I had
once written an extension for ld65 that marks write protected segments as
such in the VICE label file (something like the write protect feature of a
MMU in software). Unfortunately VICE checks a linked list of breakpoints
with each instruction referencing memory. With a list of 10 entries this
made the emulation almost unusable. So I wrote some code that manages a
shadow bitmap for the breakpoints, that tells for each address if it has a
breakpoint associated. So when referencing memory, the bitmap has to be
checked (which is much faster than walking through a linked list checking an
address range each time), and only if the result is true, the linked list
has to be searched for the real breakpoint and any associated conditions.

I sent the code to Daniel (there were some misunderstandings on my side, so
we had a discussion and as a result it was clear that my code could not be
used as is), but I don't know if it is now in the official code. Maybe you
have seen something like that when looking through the monitor? Having write
protected segments makes it much easier to find dangling pointers and other
memory overwrite conditions (this is why I wanted this feature in the first
place). If the feature is now in VICE, I will have to update ld65 to use the
correct syntax.

&gt; Well, if you need some help, at least for the PC part, I have some sources
&gt; flying around which implement a simple protocol and access the UART
&gt; directly (under DOS).

My plan was to use spunk (<a href="http://www.von-bassewitz.de/uz/spunk/">http://www.von-bassewitz.de/uz/spunk/</a>). It has
serial routines for all supported operating systems (DOS, OS/2, Windows and
several Unices including Linux), code for a turbo vision style text mode
interface and some more stuff. Text mode interfaces are somewhat outdated,
but they can be made quite portable which is clearly an advantage.

&gt; Well, I know that optimizations are very bad regarding source level
&gt; debuggers; but isn't it possible to generate the references at least
&gt; when compiling w/o any optimizations at all?

I'm not sure if this is really worth the effort, since the compiler
generated code is really bad without optimization. And, line information is
only one part. To access local variables, information about the stack offset
of these variables has to be generated. But since the generated code does
not use a base pointer (this would be difficult on the 6502 since it does
only allow positive offsets to an address), stack pointer plus offset is
used to access local variables. This means that the compiler has to emit
debug information with every change of the stack pointer - which is quite
often, since the stack is used in almost any expression that has more than
one operand.

&gt; To be honest: I first went to VICE wanting to improve the monitor,
&gt; and I looked for CC65 because I would need an environment that
&gt; supports the further options (esp. source level debugging) I want
&gt; to add because else, they would be useless. So, I wanted to check
&gt; if it could be handled by CC65 before I propose this extension to
&gt; the VICE group.

The VICE monitor is nice, but in my eyes it is crafted too much after gdb.
While both (gdb and the VICE monitor) are extremely powerful, one has
problems to find an interface that is more unfriendly to the user.

What I would like to see is an interface like the one in the old Borland
Turbo Debugger. Stepping through the code is easy with VICE, but you have to
enter commands to look at the stack or a memory area after each step. Having
a fullscreen debugger that allows you to step through the code while stack,
registers and a selectable memory range are in view would be a *great*
improvement. Heck, when it comes to user friendlyness, even the cc65
debugger modules is better than VICE, and I do in fact prefer it in cases
where I do not need the additional power of the VICE monitor.

Regards


	Uz
