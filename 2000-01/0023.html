Hi Groepaz,

let's make a statement to some of your statements...


&gt;however, seeking WILL also be supported by the kernal-driver, but will perform
&gt;awfully bad ofcoz (only way to seek would be to read sequentially from the
&gt;start,

Well, you could keep a seek pointer with every file, so at least forward
seeks would be possible w/o going through the _whole_ file.

Another way would be to only read the 2 first bytes from the needed blocks
from the disc, so you would need need to transfer all the unneeded bytes
over the serial bus, this should speed up the seek a little. You could
also keep track of all these link bytes once read (i.e., when the first
seek is started), so you can make further seeks() much more faster...


&gt;there will be, however, a somewhat 'generic' driver for floppy-drives though,
&gt;that
&gt;will support real seeking via direkt disc-access.

Hm, it seems you thought about something similar to my thoughts above,
didn't you?


&gt;&gt; The low level functions should handle three file descriptors without any
&gt;&gt; further action:
&gt;&gt;         0       stdin
&gt;&gt;         1       stdout
&gt;&gt;         2       stderr

&gt;ehrm... /me confused =) ... do you mean that first descriptor my open() returns
&gt;should be 3

Well, Ullrich obviously means that, yes.


&gt;and whenever my read/write routines are called with descriptors 0-2
&gt;as parameters they should simply map the call to stdin etc ?

No, I don't believe that is meant.


The descriptors 0-2 are like any other descriptor.

It's best to think the following way:
When starting up, your routines should perform something like

open 0,0,0 : rem open keyboard as stdin
open 1,3,0 : rem open screen as stdout
open 2,3,0 : rem open screen as stderr

(well, on Unix/DOS/WIN, these are not opened by the startup code
but rather by the OS.)

So, the special processing of handles 0-2 is not in the i/o routines
but in the initialization.

&gt;IF so, what is the
&gt;standard way to SET what IS the, eg, stdin ?! (what c-function ? or should the
&gt;OS somehow define this?)

Well, under Unices, DOS &amp; WIN, the OS is the one who can redefine them.
On the other, it is also possible for a program to close a handle
and re-open it, so that's the standard way to redefine them.


&gt;&gt; With this in mind, the current behaviour of printf() makes sense: It
&gt;&gt; writes to stdout which is mapped to the file handle with the value one.

&gt;well.... ehrm... yes it MAKES some kind of sence, if you would consider the cbm
&gt;kernal calls beeing standard C-style i/o functions. [...]
&gt;[....] but if you WANTED to do
&gt;that, it would mean that printf had to call my filesystem and pass its data
&gt;through it... making screenoutput via printf unacceptable slow.

Well, couldn't you make a fast check beforehand whether the output will
go to screen, if so, your routine could use a 'short way', something
that the C64 kernal does in $F1CA-$F1D2?



&gt;&gt; It should even be possible to close or reopen the first three file
&gt;&gt; descriptors, so the best way is probably to open them using the normal
&gt;&gt; kernal calls at program start.

&gt;now this sentence confuses me again... so CBM_KERNAL file-descriptors 0-2 ????
&gt;(nonononono that dont make sence ;=P)

Yes, exactly, these three file handles are no different from the others
disregarding their initialization.


&gt;&gt; I have some specification on the 1571 (that I found on the Internet),
&gt;&gt; that even includes specification on the build-in MFM-controller. A
&gt;&gt; driver to read PC-disks in 1571 and 1581 can be made.

&gt;in electronic format? gimme! :=P

Me too (at least URL, please)!


Spiro.
