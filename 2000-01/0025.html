&gt; (are there corrosponding 'standard' functions for loading and/or
&gt; running another executeable?)

It is usually called &quot;exec&quot;, but this is a rather complex call and probably
not suitable for 6502 machines.

&gt; ehrm... /me confused =) ... do you mean that first descriptor my open() returns
&gt; should be 3 and whenever my read/write routines are called with descriptors 0-2
&gt; as parameters they should simply map the call to stdin etc ? IF so, what is the
&gt; standard way to SET what IS the, eg, stdin ?! (what c-function ? or should the
&gt; OS somehow define this?)

Spiro answered that correctly. There are three file handles that are
expected to be already open when the program starts. The values of these
file handles are #defined by the preprocessor macros FILENO_STDIN,
FILENO_STDOUT and FILENO_STDERR. However, older software (and most unix
stuff) assumes that the values are 0, 1 and 2 respectively. So for
portability sake it is a good idea to make the handles have these values.

&gt; for practical use it would make much more sence if you'd use a
&gt; &quot;screen-only&quot; kernal call for printf() - if someone wanted to specifically
&gt; write to a file, he would use fprintf() anyway ;=P (and your fprintf calls
&gt; write doesnt it?) - it would obviously have the backdraw that printf() could no
&gt; more me mapped to a file (by defining a file as stdout) but if you WANTED to do
&gt; that, it would mean that printf had to call my filesystem and pass its data
&gt; through it... making screenoutput via printf unacceptable slow.

Calling printf is the same as calling fprintf with stdout as first
parameter. stdout is defined as the file stream with FILENO_STDOUT as
handle. So routing calls to printf to the file driver is not only a good
idea, it is also needed for standard compliance.

One may decide to close stdout and reopen it as a file. When doing this, all
data that is printed using printf() goes to the file. This is what happens
if you use '&gt;' under Unix.

&gt; &gt; So yes, o65 would be a good candidate for what you are planning to do.
&gt;
&gt; cool... is there some good specs on this around somewhere? =P

Andre Fachat has a very good description on his home page. Unfortunately,
his homepage location changed lately and I don't have the new URL handy.

&gt; i would *LOVE* to support LOADABLE device drivers so one wouldnt need to
&gt; recompile
&gt; everything for every little change of conditions... but i honestly dont
&gt; know how i could do this using cc65.... any ideas?

The compiler and linker are quite fast on todays hardware. But you are
right: code that is relocatable at runtime would be nice. But it is not
there currently.

&gt; oh, one thing... how could i have an initialized list of strings? define it
&gt; in .byte as asm ? mmmpf.... C w/o initialized structs somewhat lacks
&gt; functionality ;(

It depends an what you want exactly. You may use

    static const char* Msg[] = {
	&quot;Bla&quot;,
	&quot;Fasel&quot;,
	&quot;Foo&quot;,
    };

or you may use

    static const char Msg[6][] = {
	&quot;Bla&quot;,
	&quot;Fasel&quot;,
	&quot;Foo&quot;,
    };

Regards
