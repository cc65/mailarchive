&gt; All this should only be done, IMHO, if Ullrich thinks this is a good idea.

I think, having good and readable documentation is always a very good idea:-)

So, yes, I like your suggestion. However, there are some issues that have to
be discussed:

  * PDF is not available on every platform: The Amigas, for example, don't
    have a PDF viewer (at least not one that works with all PDF features).
    Please correct me if I'm wrong here.

  * PDF is bad in some situations. Maybe you're logged in remotely (no X), or
    you just have the source in the editor and want to lookup a specific
    assembler directive. For me it's more comfortable to load the doc file
    into the editor and search for the things I need.

    There are of course other situations where PDF files are better: They look
    much better when printed, and they are easier to read if you want to read
    the whole thing, and aren't just looking for a specific paragraph or
    keyword.

    So is there is a way to have both? The Linux DOC project uses some sort of
    meta language to produce LaTeX output, PS output, text files. Maybe using
    such a tool would be possible? The drawback would be that I have to learn
    something new:-)

  * I try to keep the documentation and the tools in sync. I've added several
    features to the assembler in the last few weeks, and it is easier to add a
    new section or paragraph to the documentation, when coding. Sometimes I
    find problems with an implementation or things that could be improved as
    soon as I try to describe the feature in the docs. So, writing docs in
    parallel to the code is actually a way to improve the design.

    Separating the docs from the code, or using a meta language would increase
    the burden for me to write docs, which is not be a good idea. Writing docs
    is already a tough job for a programmer, so it should be as easy as
    possible.

  * Having the documentation in a meta language makes it difficult for other
    people to use the snapshot code. Say, I have added a new feature and I
    want as many people as possible to test it and give me some feedback. The
    feature is described somewhere in the docs. How many of the Windows people
    out there would be able to translate LaTeX (or DocBook, or SGML, or ...)
    into something readable (or printable)?

Writing the docs in LaTeX wouldn't be a problem for me (I do all my business
stuff in LaTex), so I could use it instead of plain text files. I'm not sure
about the other things mentioned. How many of you have actually read the docs?
Would it be ok to have it in LaTeX or PostScript format? What format would be
usable for as many people as possible?

Maybe we could separate the docs? An introduction to the compiler plus some
docs for the C library are likely not to change with every compiler release.
So maybe we can have such a documentation as an addon?

A lot of question marks here:-)

&gt; Any comments, especially about content (did I miss anything?) are
&gt; welcome.

I have thought about adding another text file that describes porting the
runtime to other 6502 systems. This is not too difficult once you know how to
do it, and it would save me some work, since I have explained it in email over
and over again. There are a lot of homemade 6502 systems out there that could
benefit from a C compiler.

Regards
