&gt; I think, having good and readable documentation is always a very good idea:-)

The ASCII docs are already quite good, content-wise.

&gt; So, yes, I like your suggestion. However, there are some issues that have to
&gt; be discussed:
&gt; 
&gt;   * PDF is not available on every platform: The Amigas, for example, don't
&gt;     have a PDF viewer (at least not one that works with all PDF features).
&gt;     Please correct me if I'm wrong here.

Using a format like TexInfo or DocBook would allow us to use HTML, PDF and
plain-text generating backends.

&gt;   * PDF is bad in some situations. Maybe you're logged in remotely (no X), or
&gt;     you just have the source in the editor and want to lookup a specific
&gt;     assembler directive. For me it's more comfortable to load the doc file
&gt;     into the editor and search for the things I need.

True. Having PDF as the only target format would be bad, I realise now.
Although in a scenario like you draw out, I'd be happy with a printed
manual next to my computer.

&gt;     Separating the docs from the code, or using a meta language would increase
&gt;     the burden for me to write docs, which is not be a good idea. Writing docs
&gt;     is already a tough job for a programmer, so it should be as easy as
&gt;     possible.

True. Perhaps, a task-splitup would be a path worth considering: you could
maintain the &quot;definitive&quot; plain-ASCII versions, and others (like me) could
maintain a neatly formatted version, that would be lagging a bit. I'd be
quite happy with that.

&gt; A lot of question marks here:-)

Oh well, I guess I'll just put some effort into a preliminary version over
the next couple of weeks. I'll look into a fitting format, then post a
message to the mailing list when it looks presentable. We would then be in
a better position to decide what to do. I wouldn't even mind if my efforts
would be thrown away eventually. For me, this kind of thing is mostly just
another way to spend some time away from the graduation work :-) 

&gt; I have thought about adding another text file that describes porting the
&gt; runtime to other 6502 systems. This is not too difficult once you know how to
&gt; do it, and it would save me some work, since I have explained it in email over
&gt; and over again. There are a lot of homemade 6502 systems out there that could
&gt; benefit from a C compiler.

That would be a great idea.

A few final questions:

* couldn't you grant read-only access to your CVS repository from the
  outside? Perhaps the daily snapshot thing works for a lot of people, but
  I'd rather work with a consistent set of stuff, and maintain the
  fallback option in case anything goes awry.

* What is the approximate release frequency?

* Will the Atari stuff as implemented my Mark Keates be part of the next
  release? I tested it quite a bit now, and it seems to work a-ok.

Regards, Sidney
