Hi!

&gt; Using a format like TexInfo or DocBook would allow us to use HTML, PDF and
&gt; plain-text generating backends.

Is the dvitty driver still available? If so, we could use LaTeX. This
would allow to create text, postscript and (using PS as an intermediate
format) many other things like PDF.

&gt; Oh well, I guess I'll just put some effort into a preliminary version over
&gt; the next couple of weeks. I'll look into a fitting format, then post a
&gt; message to the mailing list when it looks presentable. We would then be in
&gt; a better position to decide what to do. I wouldn't even mind if my efforts
&gt; would be thrown away eventually. For me, this kind of thing is mostly just
&gt; another way to spend some time away from the graduation work :-)

Thanks a lot for the offer! I would suggest using the docs from the
current snapshot as a starting point. If you need any help, just drop me
a note.

&gt; * couldn't you grant read-only access to your CVS repository from the
&gt;   outside? Perhaps the daily snapshot thing works for a lot of people, but
&gt;   I'd rather work with a consistent set of stuff, and maintain the
&gt;   fallback option in case anything goes awry.

Public CVS is already there. I have posted the necessary data some time
before christmas here in the list. The relevant paragraph was:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
You may also access the source repository directly using readonly CVS:

    	protocol:	pserver
    	login:	   	guest
    	password:  	guest
    	host:	   	trixie.musoftware.de
    	repository:	/disk2/cvspub
    	branch:	   	OLDBRANCH

So you would do a

    cvs -d :pserver:<a href="mailto:guest_at_trixie.musoftware.de?Subject=Re:%20[cc65]%20documentation">guest_at_trixie.musoftware.de</a>:/disk2/cvspub login

and then

    cvs -d :pserver:<a href="mailto:guest_at_trixie.musoftware.de?Subject=Re:%20[cc65]%20documentation">guest_at_trixie.musoftware.de</a>:/disk2/cvspub checkout -r OLDBRANCH cc65

Adding &quot;-z 9&quot; for compression may also be a good idea.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can also offer write access to the repository, but this requires a
static IP address since I don't want to open up the local firewall for
anyone (the internet is a dangerous place:-).

&gt; * What is the approximate release frequency?

This varies a lot. It depends (among other things) on the bugs found: If
someone finds a serious bug, I will try to put out a new release as soon
as possible.

Currently, the compiler seems to be quite stable, so I'm not in a hurry.
I have added a lot of stuff to the assembler (listing support, unnamed
labels, several builtin functions to work with macro arguments, a more C
like macro facility and several emulation features that should ease
porting code that was written for other assemblers). Currently missing in
the assembler is support for scopes in the generated debug info, so
labels and constants may have a scope attached. There is currently no
debugger that is able to use this feature, but the availability may help
in developing these extensions.

For the next release, I will try not to do anything new with the
compiler, but make existing things more complete. I will have a look at
several of the library functions currently written in C. Rewriting some
of them in assembly will make the code smaller and faster.

&gt; * Will the Atari stuff as implemented my Mark Keates be part of the next
&gt;   release? I tested it quite a bit now, and it seems to work a-ok.

I'm don't know the current state of the port. I had some discussions
about licenses and using existing code (in this case, code from the old
cc65 compiler for the Atari). I have added some files that Mark sent me
to the current development version, but the port does not seem to be
complete. Mark, can you comment on this?

Regarding licensing: I had several discussions about it and it seems that
this is a problem, since different people have different opinions how
this should be handled. After some contemplation, I came to the following
conclusion:

Code that is not covered by the existing license will not go into the CVS
repository and will not be distributed with the releases made by me. I do
this, to remove any doubt about distribution of the compiler and binaries
created with the library. A user shouldn't be forced to check half a
dozen licenses to see if he can distribute his binaries written with
cc65, if he can take money for it, must distribute sources, object files,
or whatever.

On the other side, if anyone has a piece of code that is covered by
another license, I will respect and honour that. I will work together
with you to make sure your code integrates as easy as possible with the
existing code, and - if you want that - I do offer to distribute &quot;addon&quot;
archives together with the official releases. As an example, if you have
a compression library that is GPLed, I will offer to help you to make the
code available in an archive that may be unpacked and integrates into the
existing directory tree, so any user is able to install it in addition to
the official code by just unpacking your archive in the official tree.

Having this clear policy regarding software licenses should hopefully
make my life easier in the future:-)

Regards


	Uz
