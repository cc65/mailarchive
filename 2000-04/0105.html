If I find the necessary information freely available on the net, I will assume
that the &quot;trade secret&quot; is no longer a secret, will check back with the people
that paid me and probably add the small include file that is currently missing
in the freeware version.

Until that happens, I will handle the information as confidential and the
world has to live without sunplus support in ca65 (as it did before:-). I do
consider the decision to keep an opcode set secret stupid and not very helpful
for sunplus and its customers, but I'm neither sunplus, nor one of its
customers, so I don't care.

I don't think, violating the &quot;trade secret&quot; is a good idea. It may be worth
considering in other situations, but in this situation, it would be better to
talk to them. It seems to me that they do not realize what it means to keep an
opcode set secret. As Eric told me, the CPU core he is using is fully 65C02
compatible, so maybe they have even learned something and would release the
data sheet for their soundcore CPUs if there is enough customer demand. If you
are a sunplus customer, it may be worth a try.

&gt; N.D.A.'s suck dick! information wants to be free!

I have not signed an NDA, I just promised to keep the data confidential. And I
will keep this promise as long as the &quot;trade secret&quot; is intact. It was my own
decision to accept the terms of the contract (I have to admit, I was somewhat
curious:-), and it would be very immoral to break it.
