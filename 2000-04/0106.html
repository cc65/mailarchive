&gt; No offence.

No problem:-)

&gt; How does a firm sell a chip, and say it's a secret how to program them? If
&gt; people don't know the chip, they can't program it. If they can't program it,
&gt; they can't use it.

I don't know how they do it. I wondered about that myself. A company paid me
(more exact: they promised to pay me:-) for adding support for the SunPlus
soundchip core CPUs to ca65. Since the opcodes and other basic information is
considered a trade secret, I had to promise that the changes will not show up
in the freeware version. I'm pretty sure this is not in the interest of the
SunPlus customers (they have a *very* limited choice of assemblers), but
SunPlus does not seem to care about things like this. Maybe it's just that
they have never thought this may cause problems.

&gt; Hmmm... maybe I'm wrong again. Maybe it's a new chip-concept, that isn't out
&gt; yet. Then the info will probably be there, when it's out. (Kinda like
&gt; Transmeta's new WebPad Chip).

No. These chips are available for some time now. The decision seems to be
based on company policy. You may have a look at the company web page yourself:
<a href="http://www.sunplus.com.tw/">http://www.sunplus.com.tw/</a>

&gt; Sorry for taking your time with all these stupid thoughts.

This is a discussion list, and I have some free time, so I'm glad to discuss
anything with anyone:-)

Regards


	Uz
