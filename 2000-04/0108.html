&gt; I'd be interested to learn what plans there are for the further development
&gt; of the cc65 packages. (I noticed the 'roadmap' link on the cc65 web page
&gt; doesn't point to anything.)

I had to change the roadmap several times so I decided it is better to remove
the stuff from the web page, because it was wrong anyway:-)

One major problem with the compiler is that it is at its limits and beyond.
The compiler was never thought to do all the things I did with it. The sources
are in a state, were changing some minor piece of code in one place will break
totally unrelated things in other places, resulting in hours of debugging.

In other words: Main parts of the compiler need a total rewrite. I tried twice
to do that, but failed for several reasons.

However, things are not completely lost: I have rewritten the complete symbol
table handling last week (register variables and gotos are still broken, I
will fix that soon). This is one of the two major steps needed to get a new
version of the compiler, one that has a clean source and may be extended
without problems.

The second step is to rewrite the parser, so it will no longer create
assembler code directly, but use an apropriate intermediate code. I have some
plans for it, but as usual there is no time frame. Things should be easier
with the new symbol table code, however.

Until this rewrite has happened, it doesn't make sense to add anything besides
really minor stuff to the compiler. So I'm concentrating on the rewrite, and
on bugfixing and adding stuff to the library.

&gt; I've made a brief start on writing cc65 versions of the Unix 'nm' and 'dump'
&gt; tools which I often find useful at various stages of development.  If
&gt; anyone's interested I'd be happy to make them available when I'm a little
&gt; further forward.
&gt;
&gt; I'm prepared to take on technical work that might be required - only, of
&gt; course, if outside help is what is wanted.

Having tools like this would be great, and of course any help is appreciated!
I do offer write access to the CVS repository for cc65 developers. There are
some other issues (licensing issues, ...) that would better be discussed in
private mail.

Regards


	Uz
