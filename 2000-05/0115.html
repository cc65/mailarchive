Sorry for the late answer...

You are right, there is currently no feature to repeat pieces of code and it
would be nice to have one. A .REPEAT pseudo instruction is planned for the
next release, and the token is already reserved in the current development
version.

&gt; ... what one would expect from the above is, an output file like this:
&gt;
&gt; $0800-	scrn1.bin
&gt; $0c00-  scrn2.bin
&gt; $2000-  assembled &quot;bogus.s&quot;
&gt;
&gt; and that even, regardless the size of the scrn1/scrn2.bin files (as long as
&gt; they dont exceed their segment size).
&gt;
&gt; but instead, the linker puts them seamlessly one after the other, since
&gt; &quot;fill=no&quot; is the default value. maybe this is conveniant for use with
&gt; compilers, but i think &quot;fill=yes&quot; would be more like what you would want
&gt; when hand-writing asm code ;=P

Well, it is not, what I would expect:-)

More serious: The linker relocates the code and places it into the given
file(s). For anything else, it needs explicit commands. I don't think, using a
default of &quot;fill=yes&quot; will have any real advantages. It will give larger files
and will also fill the last segment, so the binary file will usually get a lot
larger than needed. 

Maybe this is more a documentation problem. What you expect from the linker is
a result of what you have read about it, so it seems the docs are not clear
enough about the memory layout of the resulting file. I will have a look at it
as soon as I find some time.

Regards
