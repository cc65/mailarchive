&gt; (reverse engineered from the C64).

I hope you did not put too much work into reverse engineering. As the &quot;author&quot;
of &quot;Elite 128&quot;, I have already done that (well, not completely, but &gt; 75%).
The source is ready for ca65 already and several tools (written in C++) are
available (compressing text, encoding and compressing the flight console,
...). The only problem seems to be that David Braben is somewhat picky about
his Elite copyright. I have permission from Ian Bell for publicing the hacked
Elite version (he named it &quot;Elite B&quot; and it's available from his home page),
but not from David Braben (he did not respond to my email). Ian told me that
he does not care if I make the source public, but he suggested not to do it,
because of D.B. So we will have to talk about use of the sources.

My current version has several advanced features compared to the last public
version (e.g. uses double buffering for the graphics - this gives an excellent
view without any flicker, SuperCPU support, a ship encyclopedia is available
with the SCPU, ...) but it does also have some nasty bugs, so maybe using an
older version for the port would be ok. I have not worked on it for about a
year.								 

And of cause all this is slightly off-topic (but at least it assembles with
ca65 and links with ld65 :-).

Regards
