&gt; 1) DON'T use the MingW port of GCC. While its produces &quot;better&quot; binaries and
&gt; its also somewhat easier to handle on the first glance, it really SUX for
&gt; porting linux stuff to windoze. With cygwin you get an environment that
&gt; is quite close to a linux shell, so most linux based stuff compiles out of
&gt; the box (including nifty configure-scripts etc pp)
	   
Nothing in cc65 is &quot;linux stuff&quot;. All of the tools were multi-platform from
day one, and even the first cc65 version produced by me was available for DOS,
Windows, OS/2 and Linux. So while your arguments may be true for some hardcore
Unix software, they are definitely NOT true for cc65.

In fact, I've tried to translate cc65 with the MingW compiler this afternoon
because of another problem (see below), and apart from about 5 really minor
problems (include paths and similar things) the sources compiled and worked
without problems.

So for a windows programmer I would repeat my suggestion: Use MingW instead of
CygWin. It is really easy to setup, much more Windows like, creates
executables that run without a 3MB monster DLL, and last but not least: It
compiles cc65 without major problems.

To port hardcore Unix programs, CygWin is probably a better solution, but for
cc65 the additional features are not needed and the more complex handling is
annoying. This is of course just my own humble opinion based on usage of both
packages:-)

Another question regarding a partially related problem: Has anyone managed to
compile the snapshot using the DJGPP compiler under DOS? Keith Gerdes sent me
some really weird linker error message, and I have absolutely no idea what
goes wrong here. It seems that an enum with external linkage is missing when
translating the ca65 assembler. All other externals from this module seem to
be ok. I would say it's a compiler bug, but it would be nice to have the
problem verified by someone else.
