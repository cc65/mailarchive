&gt; Gcc can be targeted to an 8-bit target quite easily; it's the guts of
&gt; implementation that is difficult, but only because it is tedious to flesh
&gt; out all the various RTL instructions for 16-bit and 32-bit quantities
&gt; (particularly to reduce code size with known constant values that fit into
&gt; smaller int sizes).  The compiler is so flexible that you could conceivably
&gt; have compiler options to provide several different machine modes; one to use
&gt; cc65 register and stack conventions, one to use a bunch of &quot;virtual
&gt; registers&quot;, one to use a virtual stack, one to use completely vanilla 6502
&gt; everything, and so forth.

My assumption was based on some statements from the porting manual, on the
fact that there is no known gcc port to any 8 or 16 bit machine, and on the
fact that the existing gcc6502 port emulates some sort of 24 bit CPU. I have
to admit that I have never tried porting gcc myself, and I did not have a look
at the backend myself, so I may be wrong.

&gt; Context:  I actually started writing such a port many moons ago, but didn't
&gt; get very far because personal time shrunk to 0.  Who knows, I might try
&gt; again for 65xx (particularly 65816) as a hobby when I have more time.  This
&gt; would require, actually, using as65 and ld65....

There seems to be a proliferation of 6502 C compilers lately:-) In a not too
distant future we may have the same situation as with assemblers: Anyone
capable of doing so will write his own compiler. A lot of these projects will
never make it to become actually usable, because most people underestimate the
work needed to complete such a project. You don't need just a compiler, you
need several more tools, and if you want the compiler to be useful, you have
to write a complete C library for it.

I'm of course the last one to tell other people how to spent their time. I
know, that fiddling with a compiler is fun for itself (I'm working on cc65 for
fun myself:-). However, it is my opinion that it would be much better for the
community if people would work together more closely and use/improve what is
there instead of recreating existing things over and over. There are not many
6502 developers left, and splitting resources means that a lot less will get
accomplished.

This is of course just my humble opinion. I know that there are more reasons
to start such a project than just the goal to create a compiler for the old
machines. So, I wish anyone luck who is working on another compiler
implementation for 6502 machines. I will be the first one to download your
stuff once it is available. May the fun be with you:-)

Regards
