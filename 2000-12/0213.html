Version 2.6.0 of the compiler and tools are finally done and packaged. One of
the most visible difference is that the packages are splitted now. Most files
that are needed for the target platforms are now in separate packages, so you
need the base package (the compiler and tools) plus the target machine
package. Have a look at the ftp server and you will get the idea.

I've appended the announcement below. Thanks for all the help with this
release! Have fun!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm proud to announce version 2.6 of CC65, a C crosscompiler /
crossassembler combo for 6502 systems.

CC65 has C and runtime library support for many of the old 6502 machines,
including

  - The Commodore C64, C128 and the C16, C116, Plus/4 machines.
  - The CBM 600/700 family (programs run in bank 1).
  - Newer PET machines (not 2001)
  - The Apple ][ (library support by Kevin Ruland &lt;<a href="mailto:kevin_at_rodin.wustl.edu?Subject=Re:%20[cc65]%20Version%202.6.0%20released">kevin_at_rodin.wustl.edu</a>&gt;)
  - The Atari 8 bit machines (thanks to the Atari team)
  - GEOS for the C64 and C128 (GEOSLib by Maciej Witkowiak &lt;<a href="mailto:ytm_at_elysium.pl?Subject=Re:%20[cc65]%20Version%202.6.0%20released">ytm_at_elysium.pl</a>&gt;)

The libraries are fairly portable, so creating a version for other 6502s
shouldn't be too much work.


New in this version:

  * All bugs mentioned on the bugs web page for version 2.5 are fixed.

  * Several new commands/features for the assembler, including a repeat
    statement and target specific character sets.

  * More 65C02 support.

  * Module constructors/destructors (assembler/linker).

  * `const' is honored in most places now, `const' data goes into the RODATA
    segment by default.

  * Lots of larger library routines rewritten in assembler for speed and size
    (heap management, printf family).

  * New object dump utility.

  * New disassembler and assembler --&gt; HTML converter (beta!).

  * New low level disk I/O module for the Atari, thanks to Christian
    Groessler, &lt;<a href="mailto:cpg_at_aladdin.de?Subject=Re:%20[cc65]%20Version%202.6.0%20released">cpg_at_aladdin.de</a>&gt;.

  * New mouse routines for the Atari machines by Christian Groessler and
    Freddy Offenga, &lt;<a href="mailto:F.Offenga_at_student.kun.nl?Subject=Re:%20[cc65]%20Version%202.6.0%20released">F.Offenga_at_student.kun.nl</a>&gt;. The mouse routines for the
    C64 are now debugged and should work (but still beta).

  * Other stuff.


There is still no support for the following features:

  * Floats and bit fields.

  * File routines on most systems. The 8 bit Ataris are the first
    machines that do have full file I/O support (besides the ACE port
    which was dropped some time ago). Please note that the complete CBM
    family doesn't have file I/O support!

  * The 80 column mode on the C128 is not supported by the conio library.


Available packages:

As usual I will provide the complete sources and several binary packages,
including RPMs for RedHat Linux. Linux is the primary development platform,
so the sources do compile out of the box on Linux machines.

Please note that there are now separate RPMs for the compiler proper and
the target specific libraries. To develop for one of the predefined target
systems you need the compiler RPM package *and* one of the target machine
packages.

Binaries for DOS and and Windows will follow or may already be available at
the time you read this. OS/2 packages will again be available, but since
there are almost no downloads for OS/2, so the host platform may get
dropped in the near future (again).

Thanks to all who sent feedback and suggestions and of course to anyone who
helped developing cc65!
