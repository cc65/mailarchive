&gt;As far as I can tell, there is no place in the libraries where code is 
&gt;written in an ineffective way because zero page locations were missing.
There 

No complaints about the code with out zp locations. It's doing
a great job. But my early coding was crippling cc65 bit.  Since this is 
C64 specific stuff I'm working on, I'm just looking to tweek every
bit of speed out of my code that I can. I know it won't be portable
in this form, but I'm actually working on two programs in 
parallel. One that would be portable and the other C64 specific.
The portable one won't have to worry about a 1mhz cpu, so
the portable code won't be harmed with the lack of ZP or larger
executables. I'm finding out that I am learning C coding better,
more organized, and more fine details by working out the most
efficient smallest code I can compile. I'm experimenting with storage
and address styles and substituting other functions or methods
for ones I already have working. My first program went from 2.5
printed pages of text and a 5k executable to less than one page
of printed text and a 3k executable. The speed in native 64 mode
almost tripled. Once I pulled all the tricks I could think of, then it
was time to look at what small tweeks might be made with some
ZP space. As an example I put a small 6 element array that is accessed
over and over in to zp space. I havn't worked out any bench marks
on it, but it seems to move a tad faster that way. ZP or portable
code, all this tinkering is forcing me to improve, along with the 
help of this list!

&gt;there are platforms where zero page space is scarce (I think, GEOS is 
&gt;one such platform).

One of the coolest things I ever saw hit the C64, but I don't think
I'll be doing any coding for it. With desktops like Gnome and windows
now, I'll just never have serious work again for geos. The 64 is just
learning and entertainment now.
