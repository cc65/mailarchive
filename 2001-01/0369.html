&gt; MM&gt; I know of no good machine translators. They don't exist.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, there are some that are good, but they are limited to one
&gt; domain, f ex the Canadian French&lt;-&gt;English weather report translator.

There are indeed reasonable translators which limit themselves to
artificial languages. I thought we were talking about natural
languages. I am aware of the canadian weather report translator. But it
does not translate natural language, it translates artificial languages
designed to be compatible with English and French in a narrow field.

&gt; MM&gt; Early in the &quot;machine translation project&quot;, people thought that in
&gt; MM&gt; order to translate, not much semantic processing was required. As
&gt; MM&gt; a result, machine translation, like controlled economical fusion,
&gt; MM&gt; has always been 20 years away. It is now understood that
&gt; MM&gt; reasonable translations cannot be achieved without doing
&gt; MM&gt; significant semantic analysis.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, they found that out in the 70s.

Yes.

&gt; MM&gt; So much so that no one currently has a clue how to make a computer
&gt; MM&gt; do it.
&gt; 
&gt; But people have actively working on semantic and pragmatic analysis
&gt; for decades now. Seems like something should have appeared by now.

Seems so to you. It is a very knotty problem.

&gt; Though last time I checked, brute force translators (such as Systran)
&gt; were the only ones that worked even remotely like they should.

Yep.

&gt; MM&gt; &quot;Fruit flies like a banana.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; MM&gt; Is &quot;flies&quot; a noun, or a verb?
&gt; 
&gt; Context my friend, context :)

Which requires *semantic* processing, at levels which are unbelievably
deep.

What is an ex-computation?

I can explain it for you, but I can't understand it for you.
I don't speak for Alcatel      &lt;- They make me say that.
