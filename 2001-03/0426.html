&gt; 	For better readability you may want to use macros:

&gt; This definitely REDUCES readability and obscures what the code
&gt; is doing.
&gt;
&gt; Which code is easier for you to read?
&gt;
&gt; (a)	VideoMode = VIDEO_REVERSE;
&gt;
&gt; (b)	POKE(199,1)	/* Set video mode to reverse */

Your quote is completely out of context (or my english is even worse than I
thought). The sentence &quot;For better readability you may want to use macros&quot; on
the page references the example above (in the FAQ), where memory access is
done in full length. Which code is easier for you to read?

  (a)	*(unsigned char*)199 = 1;

  (b)   POKE (199, 1);

And, later on I'm proposing predefined variables for hardware access, saying
that this is the most readable way. So where is the difference between your
statements and mine?

&gt; I recommend that people NOT implement PEEK and POKE at all. The direct C
&gt; is more readable than the macros. Even better is to implement macros
&gt; which make the code understandable without having to add comments.

For someone with a BASIC background (and many people programming the old
machines do have BASIC knowledge), PEEK and POKE are completely readable and
do have a meaning. It is easy to translate BASIC programs using PEEK and POKE,
this would be another reason to use them. So while I would recommend to use
fixed memory variables as I have done in the FAQ and in posts to this list, I
don't think that PEEK and POKE are evil. Just use what is best in a given
situation.
