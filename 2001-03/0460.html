&gt; I'm just curious, how hard is it to write a backend for gcc?


Unfortunately, as is much of the product of the FSF, the source for gcc
is a confusingly messy disaster.

I speak as one who has done it for a 16 bit machine.

At one time, we used the source for grep from the FSF here at work. One
fellow had a hard time, because it would not find some records in a very
large file. He could use an editor and find a few records which matched,
so he knew that grep was failing. He tracked it down to one subroutine
which

	was 5000 or so lines long
	had a McCabe complexity measure &gt; 2000 (20 is an upper limit of reason)
	had deeply nested if, switch, etc, then gotos to deeply nested
		if, switch, etc. labels

There was no way this routine

	could possibly work
	could possibly be made to work

I can explain it for you, but I can't understand it for you.
I don't speak for Alcatel      &lt;- They make me say that.
