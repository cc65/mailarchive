No, I'm talking about the lcc65 project that is linked from the cc65 home
page:

	<a href="http://pandi.20m.com/software/">http://pandi.20m.com/software/</a>

There has already been some talk about it here in the list a long time
ago. It is a 6502 port of the lcc compiler, originally targeted to the
Oric with some C64 specific libraries. It has been mentioned on several
8-bit web pages worldwide for years now, but has always been vapourware.

November last year, Ian Grant told me by mail that he had added a link to
the cc65 web page on his lcc65-c64 pages. This was the first time I heard
about these pages, even if I had heard about the compiler before. The news
looked very promising, so I added a link to his page. 

If I remember his mail from november correctly, the lcc65 compiler was
quite complete at that time, but , he didn't specify exactly what was
missing for the final release. Nothing else happened, so I contacted him
again in january. He told me that he had some other stuff going and not
enough time to work on the project. I suggested to ask for some help,
since it would be a real pity to drop such a project. This is the last
information I have about it.

lcc is a nice compiler (not as monstreous as gcc is) and has a much better
internal design than cc65, so it would have been really interesting to
have a look at it.
