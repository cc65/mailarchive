Hello Ullrich,

UvB&gt; The optimizer is built into the compiler and it makes several assumptions
UvB&gt; about the generated code, so it may not be used for generic assembler code.

thats what i thought.

UvB&gt; On the other side, I cannot remember having a need to run an optimizer over
UvB&gt; hand written assembler code.

there arent many to be honest, but in some rare cases it is really
useful.

UvB&gt; As far as I understand it, the whole thing with hand written assembler code
UvB&gt; is, that it is optimized by the programmer.

hehe well, and ofcoz it still is. =)

UvB&gt; What would you expect such an optimizer to do?

well, there are several things an optimizer COULD do for handwritten
code, the simpliest beeing peephole-optimization (which in itself
again usually isnt necessary unless the assembler code was written by
a _bad_ assembler coder ;=), with the exception of unrolled code
generated by assembler loops). this is the only thing the optimizer i
am currently using (derivated from the one daniel dallman published on
his lunix pages) can do to be honest. it is useful for quickly
checking the quality of old source-codes in the first place (if you
see &quot;;removed&quot; a lot, the code probably sux ;D), and sometimes very
handy for writing optimized unrolled code.

some things i was thinking of to add to it (some time in the future
... hell as if i ever had the time ;D) were:

- replacing sequences of &quot;legal&quot; 65x opcodes by &quot;illegal&quot; nmos6510
opcodes (that would be pretty much a c64 specific optimization stage
primarily useful for demos only)
- replacing sequences of register-shifts by hash-table-accesses (need
one index register, so may be used after peephole analyzing) eg:

replace:

        lda something
        lsr a
        lsr a
        lsr a
        lsr a
        sta something

by:
        ldx something
        lda lsr4tab,x
        sta something

...saving some cycles (and memory if used often enough to compensate
the tablesize)

- inlining small subroutines (with configureable max size / overall
codesize growth etc) again saving some cycles

- swapping registers in code-sequences (may be part of peephole
optimization)

- re-order instructions to get better performance when conditional
branches are used a lot, eg

change:

         lda value
         bne 1
         ; do something if value==0
         rts
1:
         ; do something if value!=0
         rts

to:
         
         lda value
         beq 1
         ; do something if value!=0
         rts
1:
         ; do something if value==0
         rts

since VALUE is probably !=0 more often than ==0 the latter will
perform better in general-purpose code. this optimizing stage can
improve performance a LOT in unrolled recursive algorithms and alike.
you cant imagine how often i have seen conditional branches going the
'wrong' way in innerloops of certain algorithms, thus wasting
potential speed.

UvB&gt; Can give me an example from your standalone optimizer?

the only thing it can do is removing some unnecessary register-loads,
no instruction reordering, no register swapping, no inlining, no
anything ,=)

UvB&gt; Maybe I need such a thing and don't know it:-)

well, it pretty much depends on what kinda programs you are writing i
guess.... the only 'common' case where i could think of an optimizer
makes sence for handwritten asm code is when you use large loop/macro
constructs for generating unrolled speedcode (and that is primarily
used in demos).

.....whatever, before i'll go for another project, i'll better finish
this disassembler i am working on aswell ;D (just recently changed the
output to ca65 syntax to be honest ;=)) seems that i really need that
one for my &quot;aztec challange&quot; bugfix thing ;=))
