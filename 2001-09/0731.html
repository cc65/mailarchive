&gt;It is hard to do anything today without thinking of the horrible 
&gt;terrorist  attack on the USA yesterday. I therefore wish to express my
deepest 
&gt;sympathy  to the American members of this list, and to everyone who
might have 
&gt;lost  friends or loved ones in this tragic event.

Thanks from many here in the US. So many times the news 
seems to show so many people and countries around the world
that wish us ill. It means alot in a time like this to know we do have 
friends too. My brother in-law was on a flight on the east
coast at the time of the first crashes, so there were a few
scary hours until we heard he had arrived safley. Another
freind at work has a cousin who worked at the trade center
who has not been heard from yet. This was so big it has affected 
the entire US and so many other counties that had friends and
relitives in New York. I gaurantee people from almost every
country was killed in this attack. I don't wish for war, but I do
want all involved caught, tried and punished. Any one trying to
harbor these criminal will want to re-think their position quickly.
Thanks again for your sympathies. And thanks for listening.

troy
