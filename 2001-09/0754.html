Hi!

Sorry for the late answer. I didn't find the time to have a closer look at all
the sources, but...

I've recently added support for the Commodore 510 (aka P500) to the compiler
package. It is on par with CBM610 support, plus mouse and joystick routines.
When doing tests, I noticed that is is quite easy to port programs from the
C64 (or C128) to the P500, because it does also have a VIC and a SID and even
somewhat more free memory than the C64. As a result, the mousedemo and nachtm
samples do also run on the P500.

When searching for more sample programs, I found the plasma.c code in your
package. It was rather slow with the official compiler release (2 frames per
second), and contained too much C64 specific code for my taste. So I did some
code cleanup (which improved the speed by almost 50%) and added a few macros
to make it compile for both, the C64 and CBM510.

The nice thing when writing your own compiler is that you can add
optimizations that will make your benchmark programs look good:-) (all chip
makers do this to get higher SPEC ratings). Adding such optimizations improved
the fps of the plasma.c sample by about 400% - it does now run with ~12 frames
per second (pure C!), and looks really great.

Because sample code is a great way to show people what is possible with the
compiler, and to get them started using the tool chain, I would like to ask if
you would allow me to distribute this code as part of the cc65 samples?

And, if anyone else is willing to contribute code that is written in C and
suitable as a sample program, please contact me. Things like graphics and
sound are great, because they are appealing for many end users.

I will definitely try to get a new release out of the door, but unfortunately
there are several areas where more work is needed because essential features
are missing (there are programs that won't compile). I don't know, if I will
be able to have a closer look at your libraries until then.

Regards


        Uz
