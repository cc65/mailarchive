Hi!

&gt; hehe ;=P i was actually already wondering why it became that quiet on
&gt; the list since i posted my stuff ;=) before everyone seems to be in
&gt; urgent need for that file-stuff hehe ,=) (maybe my code is just to bad
&gt; to serve them well? mmh....but damn i'd like to know THAT aswell ;=P)

What I've seen it is quite C64 specific but as I said I didn't have a closer
look because I have so many open topics with the current development compiler
and I didn't want to start new ones.

&gt; mmmh.... may it be even possible to port bigger c64 programs then?
&gt; what about the kernal/basic rom in the p500 (never heard of a C510
&gt; ;=)) .... maybe an interisting target for a WiLD! Demo ;=P

Well, what I said was not correct. Programs on the C64 have 50K memory
available, on the CBM510 it is 48K. This is somewhat less as with the CBM610
machines, mostly because I had to move the complete VIC data including the
character ROM into the execution bank to make sprites possible (which are
needed for the mouse support). But this does also mean that the character data
is also in RAM and modifyable.

&gt; would you sent that main.c to me in private mail? i'd love to checkout
&gt; what you actually changed in the code to make it faster :=)

I will send you the changed source in private mail and add it as a new sample
program to the head branch. Most of the changes are for readbility, some more
to support other platforms than the C64, and a great part of the remaining
changes do not help with the current stable compiler version. See my next mail
for a discussion of the changes that were responsible for the first 50%
speedup.

&gt; 12 fps is VERY acceptable now i think, considering how hard the job
&gt; for the compiler is in this case :=)

Here is what the current development compiler generates for the inner loop:

;
; for (i = 0; i &lt; 40; ++i, ++scrn) {
;
	.dbg	line, &quot;test.c&quot;, 115
	lda     #$00
	sta     L0109+0
L0155:	lda     L0109+0
	cmp     #$28
	bcs     L014F
;
; *scrn = (xbuf[i] + ybuf[ii]);
;
	.dbg	line, &quot;test.c&quot;, 116
	lda     _scrn+0
	ldx     _scrn+0+1
	sta     ptr1
	stx     ptr1+1
	ldx     L0109+0
	lda     L0106+0,x
	sta     sreg
	ldx     L010A+0
	lda     L0108+0,x
	clc
	adc     sreg
	ldy     #$00
	sta     (ptr1),y
;
; for (i = 0; i &lt; 40; ++i, ++scrn) {
;
	.dbg	line, &quot;test.c&quot;, 115
	inc     L0109+0
	inc     _scrn+0
	bne     L0155
	inc     _scrn+0+1
	jmp     L0155

I think this is rather good, and it is almost impossible to generate better
code with an all purpose compiler/optimizer.

&gt; pretty much definetly YES ;=P if anything, i am writing those little
&gt; samples to show ppl what can be done and how ;=)

Thanks!

&gt; anyway, it works fine so far, just one question: how can i make SURE
&gt; that this library-module will be linked in say straight after the
&gt; startup-code (so it will never appear in the memory which is banked
&gt; under the basic-rom) ?

You may add the module as the second module on the command line, or you may
use a special memory setup. When using banking you will probably need such a
setup anyway, because some of the code may be banked, while other code and all
of the data must always be available.

Regards


        Uz
