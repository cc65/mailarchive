Hello Ullrich,

UvB&gt; What I've seen it is quite C64 specific but as I said I didn't have a closer
UvB&gt; look because I have so many open topics with the current development compiler
UvB&gt; and I didn't want to start new ones.

well, yes it probably is pretty much c64 specific, since i develop for
a c64 ;=) however, i have written loads of portable code before and i
have atleast prepared most of this lib stuff to make it portable later
with ease. (all important stuff like kernal-entry points etc defined
in header/include files for example)

UvB&gt; Well, what I said was not correct. Programs on the C64 have 50K memory
UvB&gt; available, on the CBM510 it is 48K. This is somewhat less as with the CBM610
UvB&gt; machines, mostly because I had to move the complete VIC data including the
UvB&gt; character ROM into the execution bank to make sprites possible (which are
UvB&gt; needed for the mouse support). But this does also mean that the character data
UvB&gt; is also in RAM and modifyable.

ah ok ;=) i guess it would be kind of hard to get my hands on a p500
anyway ;=))

UvB&gt; I will send you the changed source in private mail and add it as a new sample
UvB&gt; program to the head branch. Most of the changes are for readbility, some more
UvB&gt; to support other platforms than the C64, and a great part of the remaining
UvB&gt; changes do not help with the current stable compiler version. See my next mail
UvB&gt; for a discussion of the changes that were responsible for the first 50%
UvB&gt; speedup.

got it..thanx.. your changes make this look like an entire
new/different program to me hehehe ;=P probably its those massive
comments (my comments are sparse...the code says it all ;D)

btw to make this look like in a real (bad ;=P) demo, add
    *(VIC+0x16)^=4;
after each screen-buffer swap (will look horrible if less than 50 fps
though ;=P)

&gt;&gt; 12 fps is VERY acceptable now i think, considering how hard the job
&gt;&gt; for the compiler is in this case :=)

UvB&gt; Here is what the current development compiler generates for the inner loop:

[snip]

UvB&gt; I think this is rather good, and it is almost impossible to generate better
UvB&gt; code with an all purpose compiler/optimizer.

looks almost optimal to me, right ;) (other optimizations that come to
mind would all involve self-modifying code which i think the compiler
wouldnt be able to handle nor generate, right?)

another question would be, how it'll look if you'd use 2 different
routines for each of the screenbuffers (one of the common
optimizations when it comes to handcoded demo-routines) .... maybe
it's also possible to write the C code in a different way so both the
screen and the sinus-buffers can use indexed adressing....

i'll check this out when the compiler has been released i guess :=)
it'll be WAY cool if it'd be possible to make this sucker run at full
speed (say 50fps) ;=)

UvB&gt; You may add the module as the second module on the command line, or you may
UvB&gt; use a special memory setup. When using banking you will probably need such a
UvB&gt; setup anyway, because some of the code may be banked, while other code and all
UvB&gt; of the data must always be available.

well the current implementation uses handwritten routines to copy data
from/to the floating-point &quot;registers&quot; (that is, zeropage locations
called &quot;FAC&quot; and &quot;ARG&quot;) and just the basic-routines that actually
process that data need the basic-rom to be banked in.... this way
source+destination of the data can be anywhere in memory, even under
the banked rom.... just the stub that calls the rom-routines (and
which does the banking) needs a safe place that isnt affected by
banking to live in. (and its a small stub aswell, around 2 pages or
sth, working on getting this even smaller)
