There is no way to have a traditional .org directive if you have relocatable
code. And, seriously, I think that having relocatable code is far more useful
than an old style .ORG directive.

&gt; actually, the lack of certain features (traditional .org and
&gt; prog-count assignment in particular) is what scares a lot of people i
&gt; have talked to ....

Both are non issues. If you use one file (and one or more include files as is
common use with other assemblers) .ORG works fine for most things. And program
counter assignment is possible using one or more of the .feature commands.
Using

        .feature pc_assignment, dollar_is_pc

things like

        $ = $200

are completely legal.

The code for the 1541 that comes with cbm4linux was originally written for
xa65, and it translates without changes using ca65 with the following feature
set enabled on the command line:

        --feature labels_without_colons
   	--feature pc_assignment
   	--feature loose_char_term

You are right, having some more emulation features would be nice, but on the
other side, ca65 will probably work with more different styled input files
than any other assembler out there.

&gt; mmmh i have started one when i have translated some of my old sources
&gt; to ca65..... its very incomplete/inaccurate by now i guess, but i can
&gt; mail it over if you like.

That would be nice, even if it is incomplete.

&gt; BTW... different thing... is there already some header file that
&gt; defines an api for serial-port access?

Yes, there is such a file, it is called rs232.h. There is also the
corresponding library for some machines including the C64, it was used by the
uIP TCP/IP stack and web server.

Having support for the silver surfer would be nice, because the 16550 chip it
uses is far more advanced than the usual 6551. With the silver surfer, using
115200 bps on the slip line should be easily possible with even more cycles to
spare than with the Swiftlink at 38400. But I've myself written more than one
driver for the 16550 chip on different platforms, so if it is too much work to
adapt your code, I don't think it would be a problem for me to write a support
module for the silver surfer - provided that I will get the hardware.

Regards


        Uz
