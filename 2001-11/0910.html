Hello Ullrich,

UvB&gt; There is no way to have a traditional .org directive if you have relocatable
UvB&gt; code. And, seriously, I think that having relocatable code is far more useful
UvB&gt; than an old style .ORG directive.

yes and no ;=) that is, for big projects having relocatable code and
such is a real bonus..... but for most other stuff (that would be
mostly everything except the one or two bigger things everyone does
once in a while) having to tinker with a linkerscript where &quot;.org
xxxx&quot; could have been enough is kindof overkill. (and no, simply using
another assembler in that case isnt the type of solution i'd accept
;=P)

&gt;&gt; actually, the lack of certain features (traditional .org and
&gt;&gt; prog-count assignment in particular) is what scares a lot of people i
&gt;&gt; have talked to ....

UvB&gt; Both are non issues. If you use one file (and one or more include files as is
UvB&gt; common use with other assemblers) .ORG works fine for most things. And program
UvB&gt; counter assignment is possible using one or more of the .feature commands.

hehe well ;=) .org like its implemented in ca65 kinda never did for me
what i expected ;P (nor did the .org command in gnu-assembler, so i
guess what they do is a simelar thing hehehe)

i guess the main issue with that is that people cant see a reason why
stuff that worked fine for 15years has to work entire differently all
of a sudden ;=) (i know for myself atleast that it took me some time
to adapt to the &quot;big&quot; compiler/assembler/linker toolsets)

UvB&gt; Using
UvB&gt;         .feature pc_assignment, dollar_is_pc
UvB&gt; things like
UvB&gt;         $ = $200
UvB&gt; are completely legal.

uhhh, that means i could write code like:


           $=$1000

           sei
           lda #&gt;irq
           sta $0315
           lda #&lt;irq
           sta $0314
           cli

           jmp *

           $=$1100

irq:
           inc $d020
           jmp $ea31


????

i always thought THAT would be one of the things not beeing possible
with ca65.

btw why the dollar-sign and not the asterix (*) (tasm uses that one
for eg, seen that in other assemblers aswell)

UvB&gt; You are right, having some more emulation features would be nice, but on the
UvB&gt; other side, ca65 will probably work with more different styled input files
UvB&gt; than any other assembler out there.

true,true,true ;=) then again, 6510 is probably that family of cpu's
with most different styled assemblers out there ;=) (and yeah, beeing
able to translate all and every source without having to touch them
would rule bigtime ;=))

&gt;&gt; mmmh i have started one when i have translated some of my old sources
&gt;&gt; to ca65..... its very incomplete/inaccurate by now i guess, but i can
&gt;&gt; mail it over if you like.

UvB&gt; That would be nice, even if it is incomplete.

ok.... hope i remember to actually do it when i'm back home ,=P

UvB&gt; Yes, there is such a file, it is called rs232.h. There is also the
UvB&gt; corresponding library for some machines including the C64, it was used by the
UvB&gt; uIP TCP/IP stack and web server.

cool... i'll take that as a guideline then ,=P

also, can i find that tcp/ip stack etc ready to compile for cc65
somewhere? (would love to use this for testing that is ,=))

UvB&gt; Having support for the silver surfer would be nice, because the 16550 chip it
UvB&gt; uses is far more advanced than the usual 6551. With the silver surfer, using
UvB&gt; 115200 bps on the slip line should be easily possible with even more cycles to
UvB&gt; spare than with the Swiftlink at 38400.

115200bps actually work pretty fine even using polling operation only
(didnt bother writing an irq-based driver yet) ... nicolas welte (who
wrote silversurfer drivers for novaterm and desterm) reported even
230400bps would work (my pc cant handle this ;=P) and he'll soon get a
highspeed-serial card so even 460800bps can be checked out ;=)

UvB&gt;  But I've myself written more than one
UvB&gt; driver for the 16550 chip on different platforms, so if it is too much work to
UvB&gt; adapt your code, I don't think it would be a problem for me to write a support
UvB&gt; module for the silver surfer - provided that I will get the hardware.

well, like i said.... i have written that code anyway, would probably
just need to translate to ca65 syntax (its written in the c64-tasm
atm) and a little cleanup (change function names to fit the api that
is)
