&gt; So for which purpose do you want this feature? I can see that this may be
&gt; done, but I cannot imagine why anyone wants to do something like this. Is
&gt; there really a use for this construct, and if so, is it really true that this
&gt; cannot be achieved by other measures already available?
&gt; 
&gt; Regards

First, I didn't ask for it, I responded to a statement that said it
didn't make sense.

However, I have made use of such constructs before, and here's and
example of how it may be useful.

Suppose there is a structure which is being built, which has pointers
to various other places in the code. One can then put the
initialization for that structure in the source where the various
things are created. I don't know the syntax of your assembler, but it
could be done like this:


=====================================
file1.inc
-------------------------------------
PrgEntryOfs	.equ	0
PrgHandlrOfs	.equ	PrgEntryOfs+2
...
PrgPtrsSize	.equ	LastPtr+2

=====================================
file1.asm
-------------------------------------
	.include	file1.inc
	.section	ProgStructs,relocatable
PrgPtrs:
	.reserve	PrgPtrsSize
=====================================
file2.asm
-------------------------------------
	.include	file1.inc
	.section	ProgStructs,relocatable
	.org		PrgPtrs+PrgHandlrOfs
	.word		Handler

	.section	Code,relocatable
Handler:
	&lt;code goes here&gt;
=====================================
file3.asm
-------------------------------------
	.include	file1.inc
	.section	ProgStructs,relocatable
	.org		PrgPtrs+EntryOfs
	.word		Entry

	.section	Code,relocatable

Entry:
	&lt;code goes here&gt;
=====================================

In this way, file1.asm does not have to have embedded knowledge of the
names of the external addresses used, or even which ones are actually
present. If the assembler/linker support an OVERLAY attribute for
relocatable sections, then default addresses to a &quot;crash&quot; location can
be inserted in file1.asm, which then get overwritten by the values in
the other files. A reference to one of the unimplemented handlers then
automatically results in an appropriate &quot;crash&quot; which can display which
of the handlers got inappropriately invoked.

This type of device is appropriate for processors which do not have
fixed addresses for the interrupt vectors to be placed (in which case
it is appropriate to use a section with attributes of ABSOLUTE,
OVERLAY), like the Z8000, MC680x0, etc. processors have a register
which points to the interrupt vector area.

Another, more mundane use, is to implement placing things in a
relocatable area, but on an address which is divisible by some
particular size, especially if the assembler does not support an .align
to that size. For example, suppose some piece of the code must reside at
an address divisible by 16, and no .align 16 directive exists. Then code
like this

Location:	.org		((Location+15)/16)*16

places the next code at an address divisible by 16. I have used
assemblers which supported

		.align		word
		.align		dword

but only for certain specified values, like word for 2, dword for 4,
but no alignment for 16 existed.

I can explain it for you, but I can't understand it for you.
I don't speak for Alcatel      &lt;- They make me say that.
