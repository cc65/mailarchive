Hi!

I've released version 2.7.1 of the compiler package just a few minutes ago.
2.7.1 is a pure bugfix release. The official announcement is appended below.

Please note that I have worked together with Adam Dunkels to make sure that
this release of cc65 will compile version 0.5 of the uIP TCP/IP stack
(released today) without problems. So if you had problems before, just
download the current versions and try again.

Regards


        Uz


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Official announcement]

I'm proud to announce version 2.7.1 of CC65, a C crosscompiler /
crossassembler combo for 6502 systems.

CC65 has C and runtime library support for many of the old 6502 machines,
including

  - The Commodore C64, C128 and the C16, C116, Plus/4 machines.
  - The CBM 510 (aka P500), a quite rare Commodore machine (programs
    run in bank 0).
  - The CBM 600/700 family (programs run in bank 1).
  - Newer PET machines (not 2001)
  - The Apple ][ (library support by Kevin Ruland &lt;<a href="mailto:kevin_at_rodin.wustl.edu?Subject=Re:%20[cc65]%20Announcement:%20New%20compiler%20release">kevin_at_rodin.wustl.edu</a>&gt;)
  - The Atari 8 bit machines (thanks to the Atari team: Christian Groessler
    &lt;<a href="mailto:cpg_at_aladdin.de?Subject=Re:%20[cc65]%20Announcement:%20New%20compiler%20release">cpg_at_aladdin.de</a>&gt;, Mark Keates &lt;<a href="mailto:markk_at_dendrite.co.uk?Subject=Re:%20[cc65]%20Announcement:%20New%20compiler%20release">markk_at_dendrite.co.uk</a>&gt;, Freddy Offenga
    &lt;<a href="mailto:taf_offenga_at_yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20[cc65]%20Announcement:%20New%20compiler%20release">taf_offenga_at_yahoo.com</a>&gt; and David Lloyd, &lt;<a href="mailto:dmlloyd_at_atari-central.com?Subject=Re:%20[cc65]%20Announcement:%20New%20compiler%20release">dmlloyd_at_atari-central.com</a>&gt;).
  - GEOS for the C64 and C128 (GEOSLib by Maciej Witkowiak &lt;<a href="mailto:ytm_at_elysium.pl?Subject=Re:%20[cc65]%20Announcement:%20New%20compiler%20release">ytm_at_elysium.pl</a>&gt;)

The libraries are fairly portable, so creating a version for other 6502s
shouldn't be too much work.


Version 2.7.1 is a bugfix release. It fixes a few errors/omissions in the 
documentation and all bugs that are listed on the &quot;Known bugs&quot; web page
for version 2.7.0.


There is still no support for the following features:

  * Floats and bit fields.

  * stdio file routines on most systems. The 8 bit Ataris are the first
    machines that do have full file I/O support. Please note that the
    complete CBM family doesn't have stdio file support!

  * The 80 column mode on the C128 is not supported by the conio library.


Available packages:

As usual I will provide the complete sources and several binary packages,
including RPMs for RedHat Linux. Linux is the primary development platform,
so the sources do compile out of the box on Linux machines.

Please note that there are now separate RPMs for the compiler proper and
the target specific libraries. To develop for one of the predefined target
systems you need the compiler RPM package *and* one of the target machine
packages.

Binaries for DOS and and Windows will follow or may already be available at
the time you read this. OS/2 packages will again be available, but since
there are almost no downloads for OS/2, so the host platform may get
dropped in the near future (again). As with the RPM packages, you need the
package for the development system (Windows, etc.) *and* one of the target
machine packages.

Thanks to all who sent feedback and suggestions and of course to anyone who
helped developing cc65!
