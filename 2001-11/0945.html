&gt; I would also like to add that the cc65 port in uIP 0.5 is simpler to adapt to
&gt; new platforms. The 0.4 version used a timer IRQ to drive timer events such as
&gt; retransmissions. This was changed with 0.5 so that it uses the clock()
&gt; function and busy waiting instead. Thus is should be simple to port to the
&gt; Atari and other cc65 target architectures.

As far as I can say, the code compiles without any changes for the Atari, just
change the target in the makefile. The only missing thing is the rs232
library, so you will get errors when trying to link the resulting executable.

&gt; To the best of my knowledge, the cc65 port has only been tested on the C64
&gt; (and C128, right Uz?). It would be nice to see a few Ataris, Apple ][s, C16s
&gt; and other computers Internet enabled using uIP :-)

I've debugged the rs232 library for the C128, but this version is not included
in version 2.7.1 because I'm not quite satisfied with it. The state of the
library for the other systems is as follows:

  - CBM 500/600/700: Code ported and tried once, but not really debugged.

  - C16, C116, Plus/4: No code, but porting shouldn't be a problem, since the
    Plus/4 has a builtin 6551 ACIA, so the C64 code should run with just a few
    changes.

  - Atari: No code. I have no idea which serial hardware is supported on the
    Atari.

  - Apple ][: No code. See Atari.

  - PET machines: No code. I would assume that existing rs232 modules use a
    6551, so porting the C64 module should require almost no effort.

  - GEOS: I don't know about this one, but I would assume that the C64 module
    should run without major changes.

Regards


        Uz
