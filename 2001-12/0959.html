Hello Ullrich,

UvB&gt; Hi!

&gt;&gt; oh btw UZ.... there's a little flaw in the assembler (maybe in the
&gt;&gt; compiler aswell) related to the &quot;include&quot; directive and relative
&gt;&gt; paths... looks like always uses the location of the directory where
&gt;&gt; ca65 has been run to complete relative pathes in any files (rather
&gt;&gt; than the location of the file were the include occurs) ... this kinda
&gt;&gt; makes it annoying to write general include files (which in turn,
&gt;&gt; include other files etc) except you use absolute pathes.

UvB&gt; You may want to use the &quot;-I directory&quot; option to add an include search path.
UvB&gt; Include files with relative paths are searched relative to any given include
UvB&gt; directory and relative to the current directory (because &quot;.&quot; is added to the
UvB&gt; search path when the compiler/assembler starts).

UvB&gt; I think both options (searching relative to the directory where the include
UvB&gt; file resides vs. searching relative to the current directory) may be confusing
UvB&gt; sometimes. And there is even a third option: Search relative to the directory
UvB&gt; where the main source file is located.


UvB&gt; Using -I should solve all these troubles.

err... sorry, no :o) using -I is not a &quot;clean&quot; solution.... for once
it would mean that each .inc file has to have a unique filename (which
is not an option for me since i have &quot;config.inc&quot; etc in various
directories) and nonetheless it makes it impossible to write code (and
makefiles etc) that is totally independent of absolute local paths.
from my understanding &quot;-I&quot; should be used to tell the assembler where
to find &quot;common&quot; includes (such as common libraries of your &quot;OS&quot;) but
NOT where to find includefiles that are selfcontained within the code
you are trying to compile.

+-cc65
!  +-bin                  this dir added to exe-search path
!  +-lib                  this dir added to include path with &quot;-I&quot;
!  +-include              this dir added to include path with &quot;-I&quot;
!
+-c64
   +-dev
   !  +-bin               this dir added to exe-search path
   !  +-lib               this dir added to include path with &quot;-I&quot;
   !  +-include           this dir added to include path with &quot;-I&quot;
   !
   +-projects
      +-work1             makefile for exe1,exe2 lives here
      !  +-exe1
      !  +-exe2
      !  +-common         common code for exe1,ex2 lives here
      !     +-test
      +-work2
      
(before you ask, i add &quot;lib&quot; directories to include path so i can
include them .s files for some quick'n'dirty testing - its ofcoz not
necessary usually)

ok, now let me explain.....

in /work1 ,/work2 etc are some different projects, that is code that
belongs together and is selfcontained except common system libraries
which live in cc65/lib, cc65/include, (libs that come with the
compiler) and c64/dev/lib, c64/dev/include (my own libs, just to keep
them seperated).

now lets say /common keeps a couple of .inc files which are beeing
used by both /exe1 and /exe2 .... to make things more obvious, also in
/common/test there is some code that uses those files.

in /common lives a file &quot;global.inc&quot; that looks like

.include &quot;config.inc&quot;
.include &quot;more.inc&quot;
.include &quot;etc.inc&quot;

... all included files live in the same directory as global.inc


soooooo to make a point, the behaviour i'd expect would be like:

a) regardless whats the current working dir when i type &quot;make&quot;, the
stuff should still work =&gt; this renders &quot;searching relative to .&quot;
useless.
b) the same (unmodified) files in /common should work for all /exe1,
/exe2 and /test .... =&gt; this renders &quot;searching relative to main
sourcefile&quot; useless.

(a+b are pretty related to each other as you can see)

c) code should compile (assemble) without change regardless of its
location in the local filesystem =&gt; this forbids using &quot;-I&quot; option in
the makefile for adding all and every directory that keeps .inc files
(apart from this would be a really ugly solution for big projects - i
tend to split my stuff in lotta small files)

whatever, all and all these problems can be easily solved by
&quot;searching relative to current file&quot; aswell (right after searching
pathes given by -I option at best) - and thats actually the kind of
behaviour i'd expect from any decent compiler/assembler out there.
(except borland turbo-c which suffers from the same problem hehehehe ;D)

infact, i was pretty surprised that ca65 did NOT work like this when i
first stumbled about it....seems to be another &quot;too easy to let it be
unfixed&quot; issue to me ;=)
