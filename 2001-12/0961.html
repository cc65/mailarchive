&gt; err... sorry, no :o) using -I is not a &quot;clean&quot; solution.... for once
&gt; it would mean that each .inc file has to have a unique filename (which
&gt; is not an option for me since i have &quot;config.inc&quot; etc in various
&gt; directories) and nonetheless it makes it impossible to write code (and
&gt; makefiles etc) that is totally independent of absolute local paths.
&gt; from my understanding &quot;-I&quot; should be used to tell the assembler where
&gt; to find &quot;common&quot; includes (such as common libraries of your &quot;OS&quot;) but
&gt; NOT where to find includefiles that are selfcontained within the code
&gt; you are trying to compile.

This is not correct. -I may be used for your own files and it may even be used
within a project. In fact, cc65 itself uses -I to point to header files that
are shared between the binary tools, it does *not* use relative paths.

And, since directory handling is often non portable (there may be platforms
with a different path separator, without a concept for a &quot;subdirectory&quot;, or
with a different notation for &quot;parent directory&quot;) many guidelines for writing
portable code say *not* to use a path in an include statement (the coding
guidelines for the Mozilla project are an example).

So I have to admit that I'm not really convinced. While it is possible to
change the current behaviour, and it wouldn't be too much work, it

  * will increase code size and make the search routines more complex,

  * will change the current behaviour and may break existing code,

  * may not meet other peoples expectations about the search algorithm.

There are other details that will complicate the implementation: By using the
path to an include file as the new search path for new include files, paths
may &quot;add up&quot;, getting longer and longer, eventually growing outside of some
operating system limits (DOS for example has just about 60 characters for a
path available). So special code would be required to cleanup path elements,
and this code will require platform dependent knowledge - something I've
managed to keep outside of the cc65 source until today.

&gt; whatever, all and all these problems can be easily solved by
&gt; &quot;searching relative to current file&quot; aswell (right after searching
&gt; pathes given by -I option at best) - and thats actually the kind of
&gt; behaviour i'd expect from any decent compiler/assembler out there.
&gt; (except borland turbo-c which suffers from the same problem hehehehe ;D)

For C compilers, the standard does not specify any search algorithm, it does
not even talk about search paths or paths in include statements, and all this
for a reason: It would be non portable to do so.
