Hello Ullrich,

UvB&gt; This is not correct. -I may be used for your own files and it may even be used
UvB&gt; within a project. In fact, cc65 itself uses -I to point to header files that
UvB&gt; are shared between the binary tools, it does *not* use relative paths.

UvB&gt; And, since directory handling is often non portable (there may be platforms
UvB&gt; with a different path separator, without a concept for a &quot;subdirectory&quot;, or
UvB&gt; with a different notation for &quot;parent directory&quot;) many guidelines for writing
UvB&gt; portable code say *not* to use a path in an include statement (the coding
UvB&gt; guidelines for the Mozilla project are an example).

ok, for that reason, i could maybe understand (although practically a
straight compile works fine for me for dos/win/linux/macos/amiga
targets with liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitle modification for each version - a
handfull related functions for path-handling etc encapsulated in
seperate files does the trick pretty well .... win/linux/macos should
work without modification whatsoever)

what do these guidelines say about how to name include files then? (it
kinda makes having several files with the same name a lottery ..... hu
which one will be included this time? ;=))

UvB&gt; So I have to admit that I'm not really convinced. While it is possible to
UvB&gt; change the current behaviour, and it wouldn't be too much work, it

UvB&gt;   * will increase code size and make the search routines more complex,

yes surely will :O) just like shooting the lightbulb results in
darkness ;D

UvB&gt;   * will change the current behaviour and may break existing code,

mmmh break existing code? how? wouldnt old code work just the same?
(oh no, the &quot;having several files with same name&quot; problem hitting
again right?)

UvB&gt;   * may not meet other peoples expectations about the search algorithm.

well i dont think so, really :=) most people probably wouldnt notice
the difference anyway - except those who expect that kinda behaviour
'coz they knew it from the compiler they used before ;=)

UvB&gt; There are other details that will complicate the implementation: By using the
UvB&gt; path to an include file as the new search path for new include files, paths
UvB&gt; may &quot;add up&quot;, getting longer and longer, eventually growing outside of some
UvB&gt; operating system limits (DOS for example has just about 60 characters for a
UvB&gt; path available). So special code would be required to cleanup path elements,
UvB&gt; and this code will require platform dependent knowledge - something I've
UvB&gt; managed to keep outside of the cc65 source until today.

yes, surely, for a clean working implementation you need &quot;expandpath&quot;
and &quot;collapsepath&quot; - which kinda need to be target-specific (well
they'd have a handfull minor tweaks in #ifdef 's i'd say ;=))

UvB&gt; For C compilers, the standard does not specify any search algorithm, it does
UvB&gt; not even talk about search paths or paths in include statements, and all this
UvB&gt; for a reason: It would be non portable to do so.
                 
yes maybe... but its still the way it is, all and every compiler i
have tried (probably every &quot;major&quot; one there is plus tons of
target-specific ones) behaves like this - except some really really
old ones which do exactly behave like cc65 :o)
