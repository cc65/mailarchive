POSIX defines chdir(const char* path) and fchdir(int fd), but in Unix,
there's no system call or even a library call for determining the current
working directory.  As far as I know, the pwd(3) program guesses the
current working directory by following the &quot;../../..&quot; chain and doing
something like opendir/readdir/stat to find out a matching subdirectory of
the &quot;..&quot; directory, and to find out when &quot;..&quot; is the same as &quot;.&quot; (in the
root directory, it is).  BTW, at least on Sun Solaris 7, the pwd(3)
program fails if one of the parent directories doesn't have read
permissions.

&gt; - well except a &quot;collapsepath&quot; functionality would be needed for
&gt; &quot;OSes&quot; like ms-dos...

Potentially, the maximum path name length can be a problem on any system
when you have very long directory hierarchies.  I guess you're referring
to removing &quot;./&quot; or &quot;somedir/..&quot; parts from the path names.  My Perl
script that generates the index.html navigation files for
<a href="http://www.funet.fi/pub/cbm/">http://www.funet.fi/pub/cbm/</a> does that when it resolves symbolic links.

&gt; just an idea that came to my mind (well you know you always think
&gt; about totally unrelated things when supposed to do boring
&gt; work...writing docfiles....*sigh* ;=))

Or writing &quot;doctor files&quot; (PhD thesis). :-)

To get back on the topic, I agree with Ullrich and would rather keep
platform-specific stuff out of the compiler.  There are tools like GNU
autoconf and automake that allow the creation of &quot;portable Makefiles&quot;.
Maybe you should have a look at them.  Perhaps you don't want to use these
tools as such, but you could get some ideas.  The source files (in a broad
sense; including C files and Makefiles) do not need to be exactly
identical on all platform; the main thing is that you can eliminate the
need for manually editing them.

Also, you could perhaps use a set of platform-specific Makefiles, like
Makefile.`uname` where `uname` is replaced by Linux, OSF1, SunOS, etc.
These files would include a common Makefile that'd contain the
platform-independent rules.  I used this approach for a large C++ program
I've written.  (GNU autoconf and automake ease the porting of C programs
to various compilers, but for C++ there are very few compilers that would 
compile the code.  I've only found two.)
