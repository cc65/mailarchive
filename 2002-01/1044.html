Been on vacation, so sorry this is late. I thought this might help the
OP.

&gt; It's not as simple as that, since DOS has a current directory per drive.
&gt; Things like
&gt; 
&gt;         d:..\..\include
&gt; 
&gt; are completely legal. The example above would be a path relative to the
&gt; current directory on drive d:

&gt; Path handling in Windows/DOS is a mess, especially of you start to add UNC
&gt; network paths (which are also legal paths).
&gt; 
&gt; So I would be really glad if you could find another solution for your
&gt; problem :-)

Another way to solve this is to make part of the path come from
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES, which most MAKE programs can read. One executes
a command to set a given build environment, which sets the environment
variables. These are read by the make program, and get put into the -I
paths. I have used this technique regularly. It keeps path names out of
my source (where it is a major pain), and allows my makefiles to be
generic as well (where the pain is a little less acute, but still
present).

As an example, one could have

   -I$(INCLPATH1)/ -I$(INCLPATH2)/

The environment variables for a DOS machine with target 1 might be

INCLPATH1=D:\CC65\INCLUDE\SYSTEM1
INCLPATH2=F:\COMPILERS\MYSTUFF\SYSTEM1

and for target 2 (or debug environment 2)

INCLPATH1=D:\CC65\INCLUDE\SYSTEM2
INCLPATH2=F:\COMPILERS\MYSTUFF\SYSTEM2

whereas on a Unix machine they might be

INCLPATH1=/cc65/include/system1
INCLPATH2=/compilers/mystuff/system1

and

INCLPATH1=/cc65/include/system2
INCLPATH2=/compilers/mystuff/system2


Note that 

#include &lt;../debug.h&gt;

Works just fine using this technique.

Naturally, one would pick different names for the paths, indicating
their use. They might be DEBUG_INCLUDE_PATH and MY_STANDARD_STUFF_PATH.

I can explain it for you, but I can't understand it for you.
I don't speak for Alcatel      &lt;- They make me say that.
