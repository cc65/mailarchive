&gt;I hope you (and the other people on the list) don't mind me pointing you
&gt;to something else.
&gt;
&gt;If you mean a _text adventure_, like Infocom games, there is a
&gt;compiler called Inform that you can get to write games in the Infocom
&gt;format (&quot;Z-code&quot;), and then play them on essentially every personal
&gt;computer (or PDA, etc!) ever made..


There is also a TADS, which is really cool, and much IMHO better than
Inform (albeit INFORM is more flexible) and also better than HUGO.  I have
been 'playing' with TADS since my first OO experience in 1990'ish, and taught
many high schoolers to program objects with it (as well as ObjC on NeXT).
It is fun, exciting and very easy to port and compile on different platforms.
It is I believe OpenSourced now or Public Domain or both ;O)  I don't know 
the
details of that, but the language itself is easy to read, easy to modify and
really fun to use.  I also on NeXT have a graphical front end to the code
generator, so really you can draw out your dungeon/game and then ask
it to generate the rooms.  It saves a TON of time.  I'm working on doing the
reverse, so you can write code as a hacker would, and then ask the code
generator to generate a 'map' from the rooms/code.  Maybe end of year
when I get around and time to play with it again.  Really, your mind and time
are the limits, Roberts did a great job on it.  Also, last thing about 
INFORM,
the Inform Language manual is exceptional, no questions about it.  I have
edition #3, and it was worth the 20-30 bucks I paid for it, and the money 
goes
to help the author of INFORM, who also wrote the book.  Has good game
strategies also.  I hope you don't mind this rambling, but I figured I'd put
my experiences down to hopefully help you on the r.a.i thing!!!  Welcome
to the art of interactive adventure text!  :o)


&gt;
&gt;You can read more about it on rec.arts.int-fiction
&gt;
&gt;(I'm not sure, you might be able to even compile the Inform compiler
&gt;with cc65!  Possibly not, but I was able to get it running on an Apple
&gt;IIGS [65816-based though])
&gt;
&gt;There are several other text-adventure engines out there (but Inform is
&gt;the most portable since it produces games that run in the existing
&gt;interpreters -- and at least on some older computers, even if you can't port
&gt;one of the freeware interpreters, there are tools you can use to &quot;rip&quot; the
&gt;interpret out of actual Infocom games to run on these new data files.)
&gt;
&gt;Sorry, just wanted to help you avoid re-inventing the wheel.  You may want
&gt;to do it anyway, but if you really want to writ the _game_ and not the
&gt;engine,  you might as well use an existing, highly-portable tool.
