&gt; It's GPL, so share and enjoy. =)

Sorry man, but this makes me very upset. You used code from the cc65 libraries
(which is explicitly NOT GPLed!), put it together with all the stuff from my
last posting, where I explained how to write a linker config, and then you go
ahead and &quot;GPL&quot; it?

I have to admit that I've never liked GPL zealots, but this beats almost
anything I've seen before. The first half of your config file is taken from my
mail, and the second half is a copy from existing cc65 configs. The only part
you've written yourself is the header explaining that this file is GPLed and
that you are the author (which is a blatant lie). You have not even bothered
to give credit to anyone. The same is true for your .s file: You have even
copied my comments verbatim. I suppose I have to be glad that you have managed
to fill in at least a few lines of your own into my skeleton code for your
riot.h and tia.h header files :-(

What angers me most about this is, that your &quot;GPLing&quot; does not even allow me
to use this code for cc65. cc65 is not GPLed and because of the viral nature
of the GPL, using one line of GPLed code would mean that I would have to GPL
the complete package (which I cannot do, since I've not written all of it, and
I cannot reach all authors).

I don't really believe that you are doing the GPL and the FSF a favour with
actions like this. Please read the license for the cc65 package and make your
files comply with this license. For simplicity, you may assume that the code
snippets from my last mail bear the same license.

Regards
