 : Sorry man, but this makes me very upset. You used code from the cc65 libraries

 : 
 : I have to admit that I've never liked GPL zealots, but this beats almost
 : anything I've seen before. The first half of your config file is taken from my
 : mail, and the second half is a copy from existing cc65 configs. The only part
 : you've written yourself is the header explaining that this file is GPLed and
 : that you are the author (which is a blatant lie). You have not even bothered
 : to give credit to anyone. The same is true for your .s file: You have even
 : copied my comments verbatim. I suppose I have to be glad that you have managed
 : to fill in at least a few lines of your own into my skeleton code for your
 : riot.h and tia.h header files :-(
 : 
 : What angers me most about this is, that your &quot;GPLing&quot; does not even allow me
 : to use this code for cc65. cc65 is not GPLed and because of the viral nature
 : of the GPL, using one line of GPLed code would mean that I would have to GPL
 : the complete package (which I cannot do, since I've not written all of it, and
 : I cannot reach all authors).
 : 
 : I don't really believe that you are doing the GPL and the FSF a favour with
 : actions like this. Please read the license for the cc65 package and make your
 : files comply with this license. For simplicity, you may assume that the code
 : snippets from my last mail bear the same license.

Let's forget for the moment that your email did not contain a copright notice.

Let's forget for the moment that I spent time putting all the pieces together.

Let's forget for the moment that it's ludicrous to claim ownership over the
idea of using a struct and a #define to access a memory mapped device.

Let's forget for the moment that you had never seen a snip of 4 of the 6 files
in the distribution before I released them.

Let's forget for the moment that I really did write most of the assembly in
the .S file.  As well as all of the .h files.  And the .c file.  And the
Makefile.

Let's forget that your compiler would not support this target if I hadn't
bothered.

Is there any way I could have supported this target with your compiler and
GPL'd my work without upsetting you?  Are you truly upset with me, or the GPL?

If you'd like to strip out the copyright and include them in cc65, without
bothering with the GPL, I hereby grant you such permission provided you leave
my name and email address in the files.

Cheers,
