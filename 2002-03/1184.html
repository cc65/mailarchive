Not to take sides, but this licensing biz does seem nuts
to me. I should GPL the entire english language. Then every
one would have to get my permission to write or speak :)

&gt;Let's forget for the moment that your email did not contain a copright
notice.

Using anyone's script in your own published work without
giving due credit is plagiarism. Plain and  simple in the USA.
I can't say for other counties. Permission is not necessary though
unless the work has been copyrighted. But how can we give
credit to code? We all use the same code right from the 
original source.... Richie we just move it around.

To be more serious, it seems impossible to copyright code.
If I take Adam's source, move some lines around, change a
few statements, then it has becomes a product of my own
creativite and I could GPL it too. Not that I would bother.
(Very poor creativity that would be indeed)
But it happens every day in literature, music, painting...
all artistic expressions. Each borrows from the other to create
more and better. (We hope) You should get recognition and
reward for your work, but also acknowlege those who help and
inspire you.  Can you copyright words (or statements/structs),
copyright the colors you use to paint, the notes you use to
play? If it could be done, Microsoft would already own it.
GPL is a joke to me with these truths.
Why come up with C#? So MS can own the langauge and
any code written using C#. Evil and cleaver at the same time.

Uz, your work is great and can't be denied. I bet in court your
case would win over any GPL here.
Posting the GPL and this &quot;Whatever&quot; message IS a slap to the
person who inspired the work in the first place.
Sorry for this dribbling message, but hurt feelings should have
be handled in private mail. Once you loose it in the open, you
get goobers like me responding.

take care all.

troy
