&gt;  : that you are the author (which is a blatant lie). You have not even bothered
&gt;  : to give credit to anyone. The same is true for your .s file: You have even
&gt;  : copied my comments verbatim. I suppose I have to be glad that you have managed
&gt;  : to fill in at least a few lines of your own into my skeleton code for your
&gt;  : riot.h and tia.h header files :-(
&gt;  : 
&gt;  : What angers me most about this is, that your &quot;GPLing&quot; does not even allow me
&gt;  : to use this code for cc65. cc65 is not GPLed and because of the viral nature
&gt;  : of the GPL, using one line of GPLed code would mean that I would have to GPL
&gt;  : the complete package (which I cannot do, since I've not written all of it, and
&gt;  : I cannot reach all authors).
&gt;  : 
&gt;  : I don't really believe that you are doing the GPL and the FSF a favour with
&gt;  : actions like this. Please read the license for the cc65 package and make your
&gt;  : files comply with this license. For simplicity, you may assume that the code
&gt;  : snippets from my last mail bear the same license.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's forget for the moment that your email did not contain a copright notice.

It isn't necessary. Under the Berne agreement (and Germany is a
signator), as soon as pen is put to paper, even electronically, the
document is automatically copyright.

&gt; Let's forget for the moment that I spent time putting all the pieces together.

It is irrelevant. Compiling material does not confer copyright.

&gt; Let's forget for the moment that it's ludicrous to claim ownership over the
&gt; idea of using a struct and a #define to access a memory mapped device.

He didn't claim ownership of an idea, that I could see.

&gt; Let's forget for the moment that you had never seen a snip of 4 of the 6 files
&gt; in the distribution before I released them.

AIUI, he didn't complain about the code you actually did yourself.

&gt; Let's forget for the moment that I really did write most of the assembly in
&gt; the .S file.  As well as all of the .h files.  And the .c file.  And the
&gt; Makefile.

No matter how much you did, it gives you no right to the part you did
not. The fact that you use the word &quot;most&quot; implies that some of what you
refer to you did not.

&gt; Let's forget that your compiler would not support this target if I hadn't
&gt; bothered.

Eh?

&gt; Is there any way I could have supported this target with your compiler and
&gt; GPL'd my work without upsetting you?  Are you truly upset with me, or the GPL?

It is impossible for someone to give away rights he does not have. All
here are well-aware of Ullrich's opinion of GPL. Since he did not grant
you rights to his work, you have no rights to give away.

&gt; If you'd like to strip out the copyright and include them in cc65, without
&gt; bothering with the GPL, I hereby grant you such permission provided you leave
&gt; my name and email address in the files.

You can only grant permission on material you own, which is, apparently,
exactly two files.

I can explain it for you, but I can't understand it for you.
I don't speak for Alcatel      &lt;- They make me say that.
