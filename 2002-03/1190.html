&gt; &gt;Let's forget for the moment that your email did not contain a copright
&gt; notice.
&gt; 
&gt; Using anyone's script in your own published work without
&gt; giving due credit is plagiarism. Plain and  simple in the USA.

This is correct.

&gt; I can't say for other counties. Permission is not necessary though
&gt; unless the work has been copyrighted. But how can we give

This is vacuously correct. All signatories of the Berne convention, and
Germany is one (as are the USA) automatically give copyright status to
any written material the moment it was written.

&gt; credit to code? We all use the same code right from the 
&gt; original source.... Richie we just move it around.
&gt; 
&gt; To be more serious, it seems impossible to copyright code.
&gt; If I take Adam's source, move some lines around, change a
&gt; few statements, then it has becomes a product of my own
&gt; creativite and I could GPL it too. Not that I would bother.

This is untrue. I suggest you study copyright a little bit more before
making statements like this.

&gt; (Very poor creativity that would be indeed)
&gt; But it happens every day in literature, music, painting...
&gt; all artistic expressions. Each borrows from the other to create
&gt; more and better. (We hope) You should get recognition and

Certainly this is true. But the changes made must be substantive, not
just moving code around. You might study how Eagle computer got put out
of business for having just the same entry point locations in their
firmware.

&gt; reward for your work, but also acknowlege those who help and
&gt; inspire you.  Can you copyright words (or statements/structs),
&gt; copyright the colors you use to paint, the notes you use to
&gt; play? If it could be done, Microsoft would already own it.

Words cannot be copyright (unless coined, but usually they are
trademarked). ARRANGEMENTS of words can be copyright.

&gt; GPL is a joke to me with these truths.
&gt; Why come up with C#? So MS can own the langauge and
&gt; any code written using C#. Evil and cleaver at the same time.

I haven't studied this, but I don't see how owning a language makes
anything written in it also owned by the owner of the language. Every
assembly language I have used is copyright by someone. But my programs
are copyright by me or by the people who employ me.

&gt; Uz, your work is great and can't be denied. I bet in court your
&gt; case would win over any GPL here.
&gt; Posting the GPL and this &quot;Whatever&quot; message IS a slap to the
&gt; person who inspired the work in the first place.
&gt; Sorry for this dribbling message, but hurt feelings should have
&gt; be handled in private mail. Once you loose it in the open, you
&gt; get goobers like me responding.

Ullrich at least didn't manifest any hurt feelings. He is defending and
protecting his intellectual property.

I can explain it for you, but I can't understand it for you.
I don't speak for Alcatel      &lt;- They make me say that.
