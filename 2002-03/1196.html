&gt; MM&gt; This is false. Licenses *grant* permission, they do not *deny*

&gt; 
&gt; True, but many licenses are more restrictive than they have to be. The

What do you mean by &quot;than they have to be&quot;? I let you into my house on
my terms and my terms only.

&gt; EULA of a random commercial application is usually in violation of
&gt; consumer laws in at least a couple of western countries.

Eh?

Define &quot;random commercial application&quot;.

Your statement has no meaning or content on the face of it.

&gt; MM&gt;         By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
&gt; MM&gt;         guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
&gt; MM&gt;         make sure the software is free for all its users. 
&gt; 
&gt; MM&gt; This is false. They are designed to ensure that
&gt; MM&gt; commercial/proprietary developers cannot use their code.
&gt; 
&gt; No, they are free to do whatever they want with the product, as long
&gt; as they give due credit for derived works and release the source code
&gt; along with it. Freely available source code does not necessarily pro-
&gt; hibit commercial exploitation, as has been demonstrated several times
&gt; (e.g. Sun and Solaris).

I'm not sure what you are trying to say, but it is the *express*
*intent* of the FSF that the LGPL deny license to commercial/proprietary
users. I quote from their site
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html</a>

        Proprietary software developers, seeking to deny the free
        competition an important advantage, will try to convince
        authors not to contribute libraries to the GPL-covered
        collection. For example, they may appeal to the ego, promising
        &quot;more users for this library&quot; IF WE LET THEM USE THE CODE IN
        PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE PRODUCTS.

[emphasis added]

It is the express intent to prevent the use of LGPL source in
proprietary products.

&gt; FWIW I think the (L)GPL has its uses. It is rather restrictive, but it
&gt; tries to protect the end user. But either way, the author is free to
&gt; choose his or her own license, and there's not a thing you can do
&gt; about it. If Ullrich doesn't like the GPL, that's that.

The FSF has a number of goals. One of them is the demise of
commercial/proprietary software. Again I quote:

        However, when a library provides a significant unique
        capability, like GNU Readline, that's a horse of a different
        color. The Readline library implements input editing and
        history for interactive programs, and that's a facility not
        generally available elsewhere. Releasing it under the GPL and
        limiting its use to free programs gives our community a real
        boost. At least one application program is free software today
        specifically because that was necessary for using Readline. 

...

        By releasing libraries that are limited to free software only,
        we can help each other's free software packages outdo the
        proprietary alternatives. The whole free software movement will
        have more popularity, because free software as a whole will
        stack up better against the competition.

I can explain it for you, but I can't understand it for you.
I don't speak for Alcatel      &lt;- They make me say that.
