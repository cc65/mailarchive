Hi!

&gt; somehow these follow-ups are confusing me even more :)

I'm very sorry. It's me who started this mess. I should have ignored what Adam
did, even if he used my code without being alloed to do so and for a purpose I
don't like. It did no harm to me or cc65, it was just a very unfriendly act.
Unfortunately, I felt hurt, and I couldn't resist to post to the list without
giving myself some time to calm down. My second post was not better: I was in
a hurry, because I was about to leave in a few minutes - not a god moment for
something important. Sorry again.

To answer your questions:

&gt; - I may (try to) sell copies of the game,

Yes.

&gt; - I must give it away for free,

No.

&gt; - I must include the source code of the game.

No.

&gt; Please don't be too hard if I sound naive - it's just that I don't have too
&gt; much experience in software development and didn't have to deal with
&gt; licensing details yet.

As long as you

  1. don't claim that you wrote the software,

  2. don't distribute changed sources without explicitly stating that they're
     not the original ones,

  3. don't remove the copyright and license text from the original sources,

you can almost do anything with them. You are allowed to sell them, use them
for your own projects or whatever.

The problem with the GPL comes from it's viral nature: If someone uses one
piece of GPLed code to develop an application that is distributed (and not
only used in house), the WHOLE application MUST be GPLed and distributed with
the source. This would change the license of the embedded code that comes with
cc65, which is not possible. Please note that this is a problem that comes
from the special nature of the GPL, it is not a problem of the cc65 license.

Regards


        Uz
