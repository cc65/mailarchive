&gt; So then why did I have it explain to you?

You did not.  The only question I asked in my original email was how the
parameter stack interoperated with the 6502 call/return stack.  CC65's handling
here is not exactly standard.
 
&gt; &gt; Truth be told, I never looked at either of those files.  Are you sure I stole
&gt; &gt; them?  Or is it possible that it's so simple that there just aren't many
&gt; &gt; different ways to do them?
&gt; 
&gt; So how did you know what do do in these subroutines? How did you know that
&gt; these routines were needed? They are tightly coupled to the inner workings of
&gt; the compiler.

If you look closely at my code you'll notice they're not even subroutines;
They're part of _start.

You have to zero out the bss segment; this is standard stuff.
You have to get the data segment out of the rom and into the ram.  This is
also standard stuff.  To claim that I did not understand this before I saw
your compiler is absurd.

Again, I'm sorry if you don't believe me.
