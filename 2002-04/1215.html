&gt; Like you I'm not a lawyer. I guess it's possible to distribute code

This would mean that anyone writing programs that are going to be compiled
with cc65, and distributed in binary form must double license them, which
effectively disables any provisions of the GPL. I'm pretty sure that Stallman,
when hearing this, would be at least as upset as I have been a few days ago:-)

FYI, here is the paragraph from the GPL I was refering to all the time:

        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
        identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
        Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
        separate works in themselves, then this License, and its
        terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them
        as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections
        as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
        distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
        License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
        entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of
        who wrote it.

As far as I understand this, it demands definitely that any code distributed
in a binary that is GPLed is covered by the GPL itself. So in case of a
program compiled with cc65 and linked against the cc65 runtime, the GPL
demands that the cc65 library routines are covered by the GPL - which is not
possible because the authors have to agree with such a change. This means in
fact that a program compiled with cc65 and distributed, cannot include any
GPLed code.

Regards
