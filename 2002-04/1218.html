&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; As far as I understand this, it demands definitely that any code distributed
&gt; &gt; in a binary that is GPLed is covered by the GPL itself. So in case of a
&gt; &gt; program compiled with cc65 and linked against the cc65 runtime, the GPL
&gt; &gt; demands that the cc65 library routines are covered by the GPL - which is not
&gt; &gt; possible because the authors have to agree with such a change. This means in
&gt; &gt; fact that a program compiled with cc65 and distributed, cannot include any
&gt; &gt; GPLed code.
&gt; 
&gt; But if I understand you correct: This means that it would almost never be
&gt; possible to distribute a GPLed binary which is compiled with a proprietary
&gt; compiler, since this involves almost always the usage of the delivered RT
&gt; library, and at least all licenses I saw till now tell me that I can use
&gt; the RT library, but I have to include a copyright notice to defend the com-
&gt; piler writer's rights.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this really the intention and how the GPL is to be read?

Yes to both questions. It is (almost) impossible to use a GPL binary
which was built with a proprietary compiler. Yes, that seems to be the
intent.

&gt; Does anyone know somewhere where I can put specific questions on the GPL?
&gt; A website, mail address, newsgroup? Thank you in advance.

You might visit the free software foundation website, which has some
FAQs and policy statements by Stallman.

&gt; PS: I'm on vacation until April 8th, so I cannot respond immediately.

Fine.

I can explain it for you, but I can't understand it for you.
I don't speak for Alcatel      &lt;- They make me say that.
