&gt; Well, there is in fact a large difference: While I don't have any faith in the
&gt; type who did this, I do for sure believe that there is a reason why the FSF
&gt; claims that the zlib license (which is identical to the cc65 license) is
&gt; &quot;compatible&quot; to the GPL. The FSF guys may have another view of the world, but
&gt; they are intelligent fellows and it is usually a good idea to listen to them
&gt; (even if anyone is free to have another opinion).
&gt; 
&gt; Regards

I haven't seen what the FSF had to say, and I don't know what they are
thinking. I can guess:

        If someone did this, and then later claimed that his stuff
        really wasn't GPL, we wouldn't pursue it.

I think the GPL is very easy to read and understand. I think it is very
clear. I also think that it very clearly states that anything which is
statically linked with their libraries must also be GPL.

I can explain it for you, but I can't understand it for you.
I don't speak for Alcatel      &lt;- They make me say that.
