&gt; &gt; I believe your interpretation is slightly wrong. The GPL forces you to
&gt; &gt; make the full sourcecode avaliable for binaries where (parts of) the code
&gt; &gt; is covered by the GPL, but it doesn't force you to actually relicense the
&gt; &gt; whole code. As long as the non-GPL parts are freely distributable,
&gt; &gt; everything works fine.
&gt;
&gt; [snip]
&gt;
&gt; It says
&gt;
&gt;         But when you distribute the same sections
&gt;         as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
&gt;         distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
&gt;         License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
&gt;         entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of
&gt;         who wrote it.
&gt;
&gt; What is there to misinterpret about that? It specifically states that
&gt; the work as a whole, and all those part of it, but be licensed under
&gt; the terms of THIS LICENSE (i.e GPL).

There seems to be a lot to misinterpret :-) The GPL says that &quot;[...] the 
distribution of the whole must be ON THE TERMS of this License [...]&quot;, not 
&quot;be licensed under the terms of the License&quot; (emphasis mine). Being 
distributed &quot;on the terms of the License&quot; means that the distribution of the 
whole package must include an offer to receive the source code. This is what 
is being demanded by the GPL. It does not mean that the whole package must be 
relicensed under the GPL (or any other license for that matter).

&gt; Maybe I don't understand your point.

My whole point is that mindless bashing of the GPL doesn't lead anywhere. 
Constructive criticism is the way to go - if you want to argue against the 
GPL, you must know how it works.

The GPL is weapon made for destroying proprietary licenses, not free 
licenses. Even though RMS thinks that free licenses are bad, he doesn't think 
that they are as evil as proprietary licenses.
