&gt; &gt; Maybe I don't understand your point.
&gt; 
&gt; My whole point is that mindless bashing of the GPL doesn't lead anywhere. 
&gt; Constructive criticism is the way to go - if you want to argue against the 
&gt; GPL, you must know how it works.

I am not mindless. My degree is in mathematics; my graduate work was
done at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I also taught
mathematics. Though English is not my first language, I have spoken it
since I was about two years old, and I consider myself reasonably
competent in it, having worked as a professional translator between
English and other languages, notably Spanish (my first language) and
German. Some of the documents I translated were legal documents, such
as patents. So I consider that I am reasonably adept at understanding
this type of document.

I haven't bashed GPL, that I noticed. I have remarked on certain
properties it has.

&gt; The GPL is weapon made for destroying proprietary licenses, not free 
&gt; licenses. Even though RMS thinks that free licenses are bad, he doesn't think 
&gt; that they are as evil as proprietary licenses.

I suggest you let Stallman speak for himself.

I suggest you get a civil tongue.

I suggest that you may not always know the credentials of those with
whom you are arguing.

I can explain it for you, but I can't understand it for you.
I don't speak for Alcatel      &lt;- They make me say that.
