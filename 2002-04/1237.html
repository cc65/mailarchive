&gt; There seems to be a lot to misinterpret :-) The GPL says that &quot;[...] the
&gt; distribution of the whole must be ON THE TERMS of this License [...]&quot;, not
&gt; &quot;be licensed under the terms of the License&quot; (emphasis mine). Being
&gt; distributed &quot;on the terms of the License&quot; means that the distribution of the
&gt; whole package must include an offer to receive the source code. This is what
&gt; is being demanded by the GPL. It does not mean that the whole package must be
&gt; relicensed under the GPL (or any other license for that matter).

This sounds very reasonable and would be an explanation why the FSF considers
the zlib license compatible with the GPL. So it seems indeed that I've
misinterpreted the cited paragraph. Which in turn makes me rather happy,
because I've already started to think about measures to make the existing
license GPL compatible - but since all authors would have to agree, this would
have been rather difficult.

So no problems at all, not even with Adams package (if anyone is really
willing to use it). Thanks a lot!

There is more good news: I will prepare a new release in about two weeks. Here
is a list of the new features:

  1. Support for Lunix/o65.

  2. conio support for GEOS (by Maciej Witkowiak, &lt;<a href="mailto:ytm_at_friko.onet.pl?Subject=Re:%20[cc65]%20how%20about%20commercial%20prgs?">ytm_at_friko.onet.pl</a>&gt;). This
     means that any program using the conio API will run under GEOS with a
     simple recompile!

  3. RS232 support for the Atari machines (added by Christian Groessler,
     &lt;<a href="mailto:cpg_at_aladdin.de?Subject=Re:%20[cc65]%20how%20about%20commercial%20prgs?">cpg_at_aladdin.de</a>&gt;). The uip TCP stack including the web server is usable
     with this addition, so you can have your own Atari web server with the
     new version.

  4. RS232 support for the C128. This will make uip available for use with the
     C128 (this makes two new platforms that can run uip - the Commodore B
     series will probably follow soon).

  5. Several changes regarding code generation and optimizations:

        a. Compares do now generate better code thanks to a hint from Piotr
           Fusik.

        b. 65C02 code generation is back.

        c. &quot;Optimize for size&quot; will work again.

  6. More flexible character code translation.

  7. sscanf is now available. The basic layer would also make fscanf and
     friends possible, but the missing ungetc() function prevents this. Scanf
     for files streams will probably be available in the next version.

  8. Bugfixes and minor improvements as usual.

I would like to invite anyone to test the current snapshot. There are known
problems with 2. (Maciej is working on it), but apart from this, the snapshot
should be usable. If I forgot something in the list above, please drop me a
mail.

Regards


        Uz
