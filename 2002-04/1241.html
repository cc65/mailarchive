Yeah, I guess a lot of people have been thinking about building an Ethernet 
cartridge using the same board. We seem to be the first to actually do it 
though :-)

&gt; so will the layout ever be fixed? and is there a way to get your hands
&gt; on pre-etched boards (or can you built this on single-sided prototype
&gt; board? - hard to get proper connection to expansion port here i guess)

The layout probably will be fixed in the next few days. The reason why the 
correct schematics but not the correct layout is avaliable is that there were 
some slight problems with the CAD program. I think that Peter will have it 
ready sometime next week.

We have only manufactured two boards for our own use, and have no current 
plans to make any more. Mostly because we don't have the resources for making 
a lot of them.

Doing this with a single sided board wouldn't be possible because of the 
design of the expansion port. A lot of the interesting signals come out on 
the bottom of the board. It would be possible to wire it directly into the 
port, but that would be quite tricky (and ugly...).

&gt; oh and did you talk to jens schoenfeld? maybe he is willing to produce
&gt; a bunch of these?! (maybe even make it a way so it works on the
&gt; clockport of the retroreplay - and thus also useful for amiga users
&gt; ;=))

No, we haven't talked to anyone about this until now. But we are hoping that 
someone will pick this up and perhaps start manufacturing more TFE cards. I 
wouldn't mind buying one myself :-)

&gt; however, i _NEED_ one of these until before next mekka - c64 based
&gt; warez-server here we come ;=DDD

;-)
