Hi!

&gt; Because the 'Atari-Lynx-adaption' of an former version of cc65

&gt;
&gt; How can I influence the development in this direction?

This would be just another port, so if you're willing to write the necessary
libraries, it is no problem to add them to the distribution (but please read
the the paragraph about the patch policy on the web page). As far as I know,
the Lynx is a game console, so probably many of the standard files cannot be
used, which would make the port rather simple. Regardless of that, I would
prefer that the libraries are portable were possible. If one of the existing
libraries cannot be ported it's not a problem. But if it can be ported, I
would prefer a ported version over some other library that does the same thing
a different way.

&gt; This should not be a big problem, since the SC02 is just a 65C02
&gt; (and should also benefit from the enhanced instructions) but without
&gt; the single-bit instructions BBR/BBS/RMB/SMB. It's important
&gt; that also the assembler dissallow the usage of this instructions
&gt; if the 65SC02 target is selected...

65C02 support in the assembler is actually 65SC02 support.

&gt; Is there any chance for this improvement? Does the compiler
&gt; acually uses (in C02-mode) the BBR/BBS/RMB/SMB instructions?

In 65C02 mode, the compiler generates 65SC02 code, but only with optimization
enabled. So the compiler should work for the Lynx without any problems.
Writing the linker config and C startup files would be the first steps to add
support for the Lynx. You may want to have a look at the existing files for
some other platform (I would suggest the Plus/4, since it is complete but
still simple compared to some other machines [C64, Atari]).

Regards
