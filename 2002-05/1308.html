Hi,

&gt;This would be just another port, so if you're willing to write the
necessary
&gt;libraries, it is no problem to add them to the distribution (but please
read
&gt;the the paragraph about the patch policy on the web page).

I'll try. Because I'm interested in developing also commercial programms
for the Lynx, I have no problem supporting the patch policy. I noticed
(maling list archive) that there was a tiff... ;-)

&gt;As far as I know, the Lynx is a game console, so probably many of the
&gt;standard files cannot be used, which would make the port rather simple.

Correct, so am I.

&gt;Regardless of that, I would prefer that the libraries are portable
&gt;were possible. If one of the existing libraries cannot be ported
&gt;it's not a problem. But if it can be ported, I would prefer a ported
&gt;version over some other library that does the same thing a different
&gt;way.

If it is usefull, I'll do.

&gt;65C02 support in the assembler is actually 65SC02 support.

So why not pointing this fact out by renaming the -cpu switch
to '65SC02'? It's a little bit confusing for newbies and the
further development when have to know that the 65C02 switch
is / should be 65SC02 compatible...
If the assembler supports BBR/BBS/RMB/SMB you need the 65SC02
switch anyway...

&gt;Writing the linker config and C startup files would be the first steps
&gt;to add support for the Lynx. You may want to have a look at the existing
&gt;files for some other platform (I would suggest the Plus/4, since it is
&gt;complete but still simple compared to some other machines [C64, Atari]).

Thank you for the hints. I'll get busy next weekend...

One more thing:
How can I manipulate the linker to build a program header which tooks the
startaddress, length of the program into account? (Or how I have to build
the startupcode, so that the linker can put these infos into the header?)

Regards
chrisker
