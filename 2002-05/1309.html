Please note that the policy is also important if you're using code from other
people (in your case, maybe code from the existing Lynx libraries). You need
permission from the original authors to do so.

&gt; So why not pointing this fact out by renaming the -cpu switch
&gt; to '65SC02'? It's a little bit confusing for newbies and the
&gt; further development when have to know that the 65C02 switch
&gt; is / should be 65SC02 compatible...

I admit it's confusing. There are some hints in the ca65 manual (it talks
about the 65C02 half of the time, and about the 65SC02 the other half), but a
clear statement is missing. I've never considered this a problem because no
one complained, and the additional instructions are not of much use anyway
(the speed/size advantage gained when switching cc65 to 65C02 mode is
neglectible for most applications). But you're of course correct, I will have
a look at it and fix the docs.

&gt; If the assembler supports BBR/BBS/RMB/SMB you need the 65SC02
&gt; switch anyway...

Or a set of macros.

&gt; One more thing:
&gt; How can I manipulate the linker to build a program header which tooks the
&gt; startaddress, length of the program into account? (Or how I have to build
&gt; the startupcode, so that the linker can put these infos into the header?)

Just have a look at the startup files of the other platforms, most of them
define some sort of executable header. In short: The header itself is defined
in the startup file, sometimes using a special segment that is placed as first
segment into the output file by the linker config. If the header needs special
information that is only available in the linking stage (the program size for
example), the linker is instructed to make this information available as
external references at link time.
