Hello Ullrich,

UvB&gt; If we can bring this into a shape where it works across all target system,
UvB&gt; that would ok for me.

mmmmh that shouldnt be a major problem.... except that not all targets
might offer all kinds of interupts (most may have a raster- and timer-
interupt though)

&gt;&gt; uhmz... dont have the actual file handy atm (not at home) but its got
&gt;&gt; everything that is available in the kernal:

UvB&gt; Bad word: kernal :-)

eh? its THE key to short code on any embedded system AFAIK :=P Also
codesize is one of the MAJOR concerns when using cc65, so for heavens
sake i'd say use the kernal whenever possible.

how is that issue different from stuff like disc/file i/o for example?

UvB&gt; Remember: cc65 is not C64 only. I know that it seems wasteful to add extra
UvB&gt; floating point routines if there is already something like that in the (C64-)
UvB&gt; kernal, but there are other platforms that don't have floating point support
UvB&gt; in a ROM.

well its perfectly portable across all cbm-machines - and AFAIK all
kernals of other homecomputers have some kind of floating-point
support in their kernals aswell so simelar wrappers could be written.
and if they dont have, you are still free to write a complete solution
yourself. not using the c64's (or cbm's for that matter) kernal
because of that reason would mean adding in a KB or more of code just
for that one or two floating-point variables your code uses. and that
IS wasteful, actually it makes floats completely useless when the code
needed to support them is larger than the table i wanted to calculate
by using them.

UvB&gt; There may also be platforms that have a different floating point
UvB&gt; format/interface.

yes indeed, and NOT supporting those (thats what you are suggesting by
saying one should create a standalone generic version) would lower the
actual usefulness of floats a LOT. any assembler coder who has used
floats before probably has a bunch of useful routines laying around
which do OFCOZ interface to the kernal and use its floating-point
format aswell - not only c64 coders i bet my arse :=)

UvB&gt; For example, how do you expect printf to work consistent, if
UvB&gt; some kernal function is called for float -&gt; string conversion?

one thing i learned when programming C is that you generally DONT
expect printf to work even close to consistent ;=P moreover, that
statement is true when using floats in printf :=))

however, a non-consistant string conversion is still better than none
- and you could ofcoz always create your own 100% standard compliant
routine once you really need it.

UvB&gt; And, if you
UvB&gt; decide to code this separately, how do you deal with different floating point
UvB&gt; formats?

easy (more or less) if the assembler knows about the specific
target-format... let the compiler handle them as &quot;real&quot; floats and
make the assembler support some directive &quot;.float&quot; that works simelar
to &quot;.byte&quot; but which inserts a floating-point number in the format of
the selected target. that could even achive compatibility on assembler
level and only the actual routines doing arithmetics on them would
need to be target-specific.

UvB&gt; And at least, there's a good chance that the kernal routines will not
UvB&gt; work like expected by the C standard.

yes, true - but who carez? there may be a loss of precision and maybe
the one or other really minor thing - but would it really seriously
break any code? its not like you would be porting that old 3d engine
of yours which requires floats to be perfectly accurate.

you arent really seriously suggesting to implement a full IEE
compliant floating-point emulator that passes all tests are you ? That
may be a nice tech-demo, but completely useless for real use (large
and slow, just what we like ,=P)

i do however not see your problem at all.... if the assembler knows
about the targets float-format and the compiler spills calls to the
floating-point routines accordingly, you could easily support that
&quot;non accurate&quot; kernal stuff and a real, standard compliant (and dead
slow ;=P) library aswell - without even bothering about how these
libraries are actually implemented, how (or if) they work and what
kind of float-format they use - that should all be up to the user
imho.
