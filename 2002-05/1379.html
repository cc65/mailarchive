&gt; &gt; In my opinion the option is like &quot;register&quot; or &quot;inline&quot; --

&gt;
&gt; Yeah, but the compiler does not know how much zero-page space is available --
&gt; this is only known to the linker.  And, the linker, on the other side,
&gt; is not able to change zero-page addresses back to absolute ones.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Of course. I also think that things get a little bit more complicated for
&gt; &gt; the linker (what ZPs are necessary; which are only nice to have),
&gt;
&gt; How do you think the linker should handle the case &quot;48 bytes of zero-page
&gt; space were allocated, but only 35 bytes are available&quot;?  I would say,
&gt; any other solution than just refusing to link successfully is much more
&gt; than just &quot;a little more complicated.&quot;:-)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; But, from another point-of-view:  Why should I abstain
&gt; &gt; from a little speed-gain if there is zero-page space left?

There are two advantages in the zero-page:  speed AND size.
(Size is why I use __fastcall__ on my C functions;
it means &quot;small-call,&quot; also.)

&gt; A possible solution is to declare and export the variables
&gt; from an assembler file, and import them as zero-page variables
&gt; into the C modules by using the &quot;#pragma zpsym&quot; statement.

That solution will be easier to do, after ld65's configure-scripts are
&quot;expanded.&quot;  Instead of providing the minimum zero-page space that is needed
by the compiler, they should &quot;allocate&quot; the maximum contiguous space
that is not used outside of the program.  For example, &quot;c64.cfg&quot; should say,

&quot;ZP: start = $02, size = $8E, type = rw, define = yes;&quot;

(that is all of BASIC's space).  Then, files can .reserve (additional) .zeropage
variables, in the same portable way that they define .bss variables (ld65 will
set their addresses).  (The start-up file must use __ZP_START__ and __ZP_LAST__
when swapping the zero-page.)

I agree that &quot;it won't fit&quot; is the only reasonable reaction when ld65 runs out
of room -- in any memory-area.  The linker cannot know our goals;
so, it would not know which variables
are merely nice-to-have-sitting-down-there-if-there-were-space.  It is our job
to adjust the code, in order &quot;to shoehorn&quot; it into the targets.
