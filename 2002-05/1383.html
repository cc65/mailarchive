Hi!

&gt; so you are saying that for example a grafics-library should contain
&gt; only portable routines, and one target-specific setpixel routine?
&gt; and if not, please explain whats different between that and the floats
&gt; coz i just dont get it.

The difference is that the graphics interface is not covered by a standard
while floating point arithmetic is.

&gt; we arent talking about writing a portable program (and yes i agree to
&gt; what you were saying when it comes to that), we are talking about
&gt; writing libraries used to compile the portable program =&gt; totally
&gt; different thing.

When talking about C, portability means adhering to the standard. If libraries
differ from the standard they are not portable.

[writing a fp library]
&gt; yeah, a theoretically nice, but practically unuseable solution. slow
&gt; and large.... sounds like windoze(tm) to me ;=P

So where is the proof that the ROM routines are faster than something written
by someone else? Steve Judd once mentioned that he was writing a floating
point library, and I would bet a craddle of beer against a bottle of mineral
water that his routines would blow the C64 ROM routines to pieces (speedwise).
The space argument is more valid, but I will not judge about that before I've
seen how large such floating point routines would be.

&gt; the point is, theres no point in makeing _the library_ portable -
&gt; except for the heck of it.

A portable library means that the interface is portable. A portable interface
means an interface that adheres to the C standard. And the ROM routines do NOT
adhere to the C standard, so they are NOT portable.

&gt; i would however prefer a compiler that produces the best code possible
&gt; - not one whose libraries sourcecode looks most beautiful. thats just
&gt; a non argument.

Doing floating point on a 6502 system is stupid anyway, no serious program
will use it. And the not so serious programs will not be hurt by the few
additional bytes needed.

&gt; i disassembled the entire kernal routines for that matter... those are
&gt; large and slow already, and they provide less accuracy then IEE would
&gt; require.

Are you sure about that? As far as I know, both the CBM implementation and the
IEEE 32 bit format have an almost identical precision, the differences are in
the internal representation, and some border conditions.

&gt; whythehell would i
&gt; even consider using IEE floats here? to bloat my code and make it 10
&gt; times slower?

Maybe you can explain how you come to these numbers? I hear you talking, but I
start wondering if we are talking about the same thing :-)

Regards
