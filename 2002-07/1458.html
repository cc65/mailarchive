If anyone is interested: I've added a first alpha version of the graphics
library to the repository today. There will probably be some more changes, but
the overall design should not change.

I would be glad if people could test the driver/interface and send me some
feedback. The current code works only for the C64, because the o65 loader for
the graphics driver uses CBM kernal calls for file I/O. I'm not happy about
this, and this will for sure change before the next release, but it's not as
bad as it seems in the current situation, because the only graphics driver
available is also for the C64 (in 320*200*2 mode). Besides that, the CBM
specific code is only in one module, so it's easy to replace by standard C
code (using C file stream functions).

Maybe anyone is interested in writing drivers for other graphics modes or for
other machines? The C64 160*200*4 mode should be doable without too much work,
because the existing 320*200*2 driver can be used as a base. The existing
driver is fairly well documented and the only interfacing is to the graphics
kernal, so any knowledgeable assembler programmer should be able to write such
a driver for other hardware without much need to know about C and cc65.

Here is a short description of the architecture:

The graphics interface is modeled after the old BGI interface of the borland
DOS compilers. Which is no wonder, because I've written and sold BGI drivers
for all sorts of devices a long time ago:-) (they may be downloaded from my
web page together with the sources). In fact, the cc65 graphics interface is
as similar to BGI as it can get if you keep the hardware limitations in mind,
so I've named it &quot;tgi&quot; for &quot;Tiny Graphics Interface&quot;.

It consists of a platform independent layer with C callable functions, plus
graphics drivers that are loaded from disk at runtime. Colors are supported
through palettes. That is, the color used is actually an index into a
(platform specific) color table that may be altered by the application (if
this feature is provided by the hardware).

The advantages of this approach are:

  1. The drivers don't use memory while not loaded, so one can write a program
     with a text mode interface and just switch into graphics mode to display
     a diagram or something like that.

  2. Drivers may be switched at runtime to support different solutions/colors
     on the users request.

  3. Common code (like clipping for primitives where this is possible) may be
     moved into the device independent kernel and must not be replicated by
     each of the drivers.

  4. The device independent kernel may contain emulation code. This code can
     implement more complex operations by using simpler ones provided by the
     driver. One example would be lines: If the driver has no line support
     itself, lines may be plotted by the kernel using the PutPixel function of
     the driver (this is of course a lot slower). I'm not sure however, if
     this feature will be left in, because the emulation code is not needed
     with a complete driver, but always linked in (using precious memory).

  5. Writing a new driver is easy, because you don't have to cope with
     existing code, interfacing to other library routines, or making your
     routines C callable. The driver is written in pure assembly, the
     interface consists of a parameter and a jump table.

  6. The graphics kernel itself is completely platform independent. All the
     platform dependencies go into the loadable driver.

... and maybe some more :-)

For the C64 320x200x2 mode I'm using a modified version of Stephen Judds grlib
graphics library. This is the reference driver I'm using to develop the kernel
and the interface. Most things are already in good shape and working. The next
step will be to write some sort of documentation, so other people can start
writing drivers for other hardware (it should even be possible to write a
driver for the Commodore 1520 plotter - I've done similar things for the BGI
interface a long time ago).

This graphics interface is not perfect. It is simply not possible to write a
graphics interface that suits all people and all purposes, needs almost no
memory, is fast as lightning and - last but not least - is C callable and
compatible with the cc65 memory setup. But I think I've created a good mixture
that should make many applications possible.

One goodie: The existing C64 driver for mode 320*200*2 uses NO ADDITIONAL
MEMORY! It does this by placing the hires screen below the kernal ROM and the
color map below the I/O area. This means that there is only one video screen
available, and some operations are a bit slower than needed (because of the
banking). However, I've rated the advantages of this approach higher than the
disadvantages:

  * No special linker config is needed. The driver will use the memory that
    is not assigned to the C program by the linker.

  * Apart from the graphics routines itself, no additional memory is used.

As usual, any feedback is highly appreciated!

Regards
