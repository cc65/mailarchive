-----Original Message-----
From: MagerValp &lt;<a href="mailto:MagerValp_at_cling.gu.se?Subject=Re:%20[cc65]%20raw%20disk%20access%20(was:%20cr/lf%20translation?)">MagerValp_at_cling.gu.se</a>&gt;

&gt; OK, the problem appears to be that the data written gets shifted by one byte.
&gt; 18,00 starts with 00 21 01 41.  A &quot;B-P 2 0&quot; fixxed that problem.  I though
&gt; that B-P wasn't necessary for U1/U2?  At least, that's what the 1541 and 1581
&gt; user-guides claim.

There are two separate operations:
(1) data-transfer between the drive's buffer and your computer;
(2) data-transfer between the drive's buffer and a disk.

Neither operation knows much about the other one.  The first one doesn't know
which DOS-command you plan to use for the second operation.  It always assumes
that you are using &quot;random-files&quot; (RELative-files and User-commands were added
to the DOS at a later time).  Therefore, the first byte (in the buffer) is a
length-byte; the computer-transfer starts at the second position.  That is why
you must have &quot;B-P 2 0&quot; when you are going to employ the DOS's User-commands.

(Earlier, MagerValp asked a question about the closing of files.)

If you use the Block-Allocate/-Free commands, then you MUST open a buffer-file
some time before, and close it some time after, you use those &quot;Block-&quot; commands.
Ignore what the books say; none of the authors understood those commands!  The
commands don't have bugs -- as long as you remember to open and close that file.

The wisest policy is to close what you open (even though the other block/sector
commands don't require it).  (But, you don't need to do it, repeatedly, in the
middle of a loop.  Open a file before the loop, and close it after the loop.)
