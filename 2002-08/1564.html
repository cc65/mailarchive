&gt;&gt;Just hoping to get a few suggestions as to how to sort a potentially
&gt;very &gt;large file (could be up to 90k) and each record is about 27 bytes
&gt;long.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;On the PC I would just load the whole thing into memory, sort it and
&gt;dump &gt;it back to disk. On the 6502 with only 64k, can't do that.  Anyone
&gt;have &gt;some suggestions as to how to go about this?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;On the Atari 8-bit 256Kb and 1Mb extra memory is very common now. It
&gt;&gt;uses a 16Kb bank-switching window at $4000-$7FFF. When you have some
&gt;&gt;software you could simulate a this memory as 1 big block.

I thought of that, but you need to bank switch the memory in and out in 16k chunks which is starting to sound like a lot of work to implement.  I seem to recall seeing a cc65 library for the atari that would allow you to use the extra 64k in a 130XE as one big array of data.  That might be ok.. but makes the software only usable with an expanded machine.  Do you have any code that makes extra memory access fairly simple?

Coding it to use the memory if you've got it, or use some swap space on a disk drive somewhere probably would be the best way to go.  BTW TXG, this is for the SmartIDE partition manager I've been working on with Nir Dary.  The manager itself is pretty much done, just the defrag/sort program to go!
