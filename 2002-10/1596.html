&gt; I was writing a filesystem support.  I was busy for a long time, but a slot
&gt; should be coming up.  Feel free to bug me if a new release seems imminent, but
&gt; it looks like you are still getting regular bug reports.

I'm trying to get out a new release as soon as possible because the list of
bugs for version 2.8 has grown quite large, and some of these bugs are severe.
However, there are some bugs left that need more work than just fixing a line
of code (the problem with compares is an example), and I would like to bring
the new graphics interface into a state where the API is stable enough to
survive at least one or two compiler releases. This means that I need at least
another two weeks + X where X is an unknown amount of time:-)

&gt; Any news on the f.s. from the other guy?  Any comments on my docs?

Several people have contacted me with ideas for file support for CBMs.
However, I don't have any information about usable code (usable in the sense
that it works with all CBMs and may be used with cc65 without problems). So if
anyone on the list has already some code, please speak up. The new graphics
interface uses loadable graphics drivers, so having standard C file routines
is getting more important in the future, because no file support means either
special casing or no graphics support.

Regards
