Hi!

&gt; i have some code.... if you look at the snapshot you can get an idea
&gt; of how its designed... however, the current version has many little
&gt; bugs fixed (a bunch of those related to compiler problems ;)) and its
&gt; actually &quot;almost&quot; useable (that is, works ok for opening ONE file at a
&gt; time atm, most standard routines implemented, except seeking -which is
&gt; going to be troublesome on cbm drives-)

As far as I can see, it does not implement POSIX compatible I/O routines,
which is a problem as I see it, because that means that cc65 would need that,
too, and not only the low level routines but also the hig level stuff
(fopen/fread/...) will be platform dependent.

&gt; i was actually waiting for these loadables drivers and some
&gt; instruction on how to use them so i can test if that filestuff really
&gt; works as intended ;)

If you have a recent snapshot, you may want to have a look at the header file
include/modload.h. It exports the necessary structures and functions to load
modules at runtime. The libsrc/c64 directory contains a graphics driver for
320x200x2 graphics mode, just have a look at the makefile to see how it is
translated and linked. There's a problem however: Since module loading needs
disk I/O, and disk I/O is not available for the CBMs, there will no longer be
loadable modules for the CBMs as soon as I remove the dirty hack I'm currently
using.

&gt; i was also considering writing a simple &quot;tetris&quot; using the
&gt; conio-module as a programming example, but i havent done that yet :)

Yes, I've also had some ideas for games. Writing a simple pacman or so
shouldn't be too much work. But since I'm already way behind schedule with all
my other projects, I'm glad I never started:-)

Regards
