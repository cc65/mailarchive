Hello Ullrich,

&gt;&gt; ??? please explain... it implements open/close/read/write basically,

UvB&gt; I cannot find anything named open, close, read or write in your sources.

fs_open/fs_close/fs_read/fs_write should be there (the prefix so i
could test some stuff easier)

filesys.h:
int fs_open(const char *devname,int flag);   // open file (returns file id)
int fs_read(int fd, char *buf, int n);       // read n bytes to buf from file fd
int fs_write(int fd, char *buf,int n);       // write n bytes from buf to file fd
int fs_close(int fd);

like i said, the current version DOES work when linked against your
highlevel functions... it also implements init/deinit in module
constructor/destructor and does some more things so it can be used
without needing any modifications in the code you wanna compile. (the
only thing missing atm is some sort of &quot;automount&quot; at startup, atm
drive 8 is assumed as the only available drive)

UvB&gt; However, there are some other functions like fs_printf().
UvB&gt; And, assuming the
UvB&gt; POSIX low level functions were available, these would not be needed, because
UvB&gt; fprintf would work in this case.

yes true, there are some functions which are unnecessary.... the whole
thing was developed parallel to some gameboy stuff i was doing and i
didnt have those functions there (well not in a form i could use
atleast). actually i was in the process of removing those occurrences
when i had to stop working on the stuff.

&gt;&gt; oh, and maybe that old version is missing certain bits aswell, i dont
&gt;&gt; remember....been a while since i uploaded that one ,)
UvB&gt; This may be the case, I don't know:-)

maybe is ;=)

UvB&gt; [loadable modules]
&gt;&gt; does that mean dropping in open/read/close would do the trick?

UvB&gt; All the stdio stuff is based on open/read/write/close. This means that having
UvB&gt; these routines, fopen, fprintf, fread, fwrite and all others will
UvB&gt; automagically start working. The later routines are not system dependent,
UvB&gt; which is very nice in my eyes, because it minimizes the amount of platform
UvB&gt; dependent code. And, it allows to port programs that use the POSIX interface
UvB&gt; instead of the C file routines.

yesyes ofcoz :) (btw to make that complete, the only lowlevel
functions missing here are lseek(),opendir(),readdir(),closedir() here
right?..(not sure about dir-stuff...i am used to M$dos stuff ;=P) or
is it true that opendir/readdir/closedir is the posix-interface and
needs some other underlaying layer?)

UvB&gt; The current implementation of tgi_load() (the function that loads graphics
UvB&gt; drivers into memory) calls cbm_load, but this is a hack, because cbm_load
UvB&gt; is non standard and works only on CBMs. I will change that to use fopen, fread
UvB&gt; and fclose, so it is usable with any platform that has file i/o.

ok...so you do this first...and in two weeks or sth when i have moved
all stuff around i'll concentrate on getting my open/read/close
working with that :=) (write aint THAT important atm).... then next thing
is still a suitable solution for seeking ;/ i fear that cant be done
in a generic way (except constantly rereading the file from start when
scanning backwards)...still working out some sort of caching. (any
testprograms around that can show if seeking works as intended?)
