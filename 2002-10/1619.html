It really turns into a pain if I try to address memory higher than the first
16kb. Would there be any problems if I changed the START variable in the
config to $FFF, leaving 2048 kb for a custom character set near the start of
RAM? From what you described about the basic header, it seems this would not
conflict with that area.

Also, you mentioned a graphics package would be included in the next
release. Would this handle custom character sets, and when do you expect the
next version to be released?

&gt; Hi!
&gt;
&gt; On Fri, Oct 18, 2002 at 02:51:09PM -0500, Brian Bagnall wrote:
&gt; &gt; First, do I alter c64.cfg in the doc directory? (seems strange that it's
&gt; &gt; stored here)
&gt;
&gt; It is in the doc directory, because this is just a copy of what is
compiled
&gt; into ld65. It is thought as a reference and may be used as some sort of
&gt; documentation. To use it, create a copy in your program directory and use
&gt;
&gt;         -C config-file-name
&gt;
&gt; instead of
&gt;
&gt;         -t c64
&gt;
&gt; when calling the linker.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Second, you mentioned the program is stored from $801 to $D000 but the
&gt; &gt; c64.cfg file says $7FF to C801. Which is right?
&gt;
&gt; The config file says
&gt;
&gt;     RAM: start = $7FF, size = $c801, define = yes, file = %O;
&gt;
&gt; So the RAM area starts at $7FF (this includes the two byte load address on
&gt; disk, so the actual start address is the BASIC start, $801) and is $C801
in
&gt; *size*. If you add both numbers you get
&gt;
&gt;         $7FF + $C801 = $D000
&gt;
&gt; which equals the end address I've mentioned.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Third, do you recommend setting aside memory at the start or end of this
&gt; &gt; block?
&gt;
&gt; Setting aside memory from the start of the block is problematic, since
&gt; programs generated with the default setup for the C64 will load as BASIC
&gt; programs and have a small BASIC header (to check that, load a cc65
generated
&gt; program and enter &quot;LIST&quot; before running it). The easier way is probably to
use
&gt; memory at the end of the former RAM area. This brings in another problem:
The
&gt; data must be moved into this range somehow. However, for most people, this
&gt; should be easier to solve than changing the cc65 startup file.
&gt;
&gt; Regards
&gt;
