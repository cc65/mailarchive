&gt;&gt;3. Christian, would you be willing to fix the code around sector
&gt;&gt;size, so that it is not hardcoded at 128, but rather we could change
&gt;&gt;it ourselves?  Knowing the sector size in my application is not a
&gt;&gt;problem, so if I could set it manually that would be great!  I'm not
&gt;&gt;worried about autodetecting it.
&gt;
&gt;Such a function would be a hack only, since you anyway cannot change
&gt;the sector size. So I won't add it to the cc65 lib.
&gt;As workaround I can provide you a small assembler function which you
&gt;can call to set the sector size by hand, but for the official lib I'd
&gt;like to have a way to autodetect it.

Hi Chris,

Couldn't I just write into the sectsizetab * 4 * drive number?  That would be easy enough.  Is there some way to reference the sectsizetab from my source code?

I still think it would be nice to not have to build a separate library for supporting system with more than 4 drives.  It would be nice if there was some way to assign the memory for this dynamically.  Is there some reason that you couldn't alloc memory in dio_open for each handle, and then free it in dio_close?  I guess that would equate to less memory, but a little more overhead.

&gt;Btw, why do you think &quot;Knowing the sector size in my application is
&gt;not a problem?&quot; It depends on which disk the user inserted...

I answered this previously, but thought I would mention it again in case you missed it.  I will always know the sector size in my application since it is contained in the partition table.
