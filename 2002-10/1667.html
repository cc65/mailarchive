&gt;&gt;Couldn't I just write into the sectsizetab * 4 * drive number?  That
&gt;&gt;would be easy enough.  Is there some way to reference the sectsizetab
&gt;&gt;from my source code?
&gt;
&gt;This would be what my &quot;small assembler function&quot; would have done. You
&gt;cannot do it since the sectsizetab variable is invisible to C (no
&gt;starting '_').

Ok.  Maybe I should take a crack at coding it myself.  It would be good practice.  Thanks for the tip!

&gt;&gt;I still think it would be nice to not have to build a separate
&gt;&gt;library for supporting system with more than 4 drives.  It would be
&gt;&gt;nice if there was some way to assign the memory for this dynamically.
&gt;&gt;Is there some reason that you couldn't alloc memory in dio_open for
&gt;&gt;each handle, and then free it in dio_close?  I guess that would
&gt;&gt;equate to less memory, but a little more overhead.
&gt;
&gt;I think the code needed to access the sectsizetab indirectly would
&gt;increase (and complicate) the code quite a bit. So I like to stay with
&gt;the compile time define.
&gt;One year ago an empty Atari program was already the biggest of all
&gt;ports. (Maybe some other port catched up in the meantime?) So I set it
&gt;to 4 drives.

Ok.  I see that this would increase the code size by quite a lot.  Does this statically assigned table even get put in your program if you are not using the DIO routines?

&gt;Is recompiling really such a problem?

Not for me on this project, I just picked drive numbers less than 4.  It isn't that big of a deal, just wondering if there might be a more flexible way.  The dio routines aren't a C standard library are they?  I imagine that you (cc65 conductors) are trying to maintain a platform independent api for them though?

&gt;If yes, what do you Atari users on the list think is a good default
&gt;value? I think 16 is the maximum possible SIO-wise, it would consume
&gt;64 bytes :-(

The only DOS that allows 16 drives is SpartaDOS X as far as I know.  SpartaDOS 3.x allows 9 drives I think.

&gt;How is your hard disk connected? I don't have a hd on my Atari
&gt;(yet?).

My application (well two applications really) is meant for Bob Woolley's SmartIDE hardware.  I haven't actually built the circuit yet, but have mounted the hard drive inside my 800XL, and have a PCB layout generated.  I thought it would be nice to have the software pretty much done first.  The SmartIDE mod really is lacking a good partition manager.  Hopefully I've built one.  :)

There is an interesting project called MyIDE that looks pretty simple to build and very verstatile since you can build it in a cartridge. However I've heard that because the OS needs to be switched to RAM and then patched it will not work with SpartaDOS.  That rules it out for me, since I like Sparta.  Besides, the SmartIDE is much more than just an IDE interface, it is also a battery backed multiple RAM OS upgrade.  I'm sure you've heard of it before.
