&gt;
&gt; Unless you're trying to port existing code to the C64, stdio isn't
&gt; really useful. Trying to get a 1 MHz C64 with a 400 cps disk drive to
&gt; conform to the stdio API is just inefficient. The kernal call wrappers
&gt; in cbm.h allow you to use the native API for disk I/O, and there's
&gt; conio for user I/O. If you want to stay compatible with other plat-
&gt; forms simply #ifdef your way around the problem and user wrapper
&gt; functions.

IMHO Brian has an important point here. stdio *is* definitely useful, not only
when porting existing code. Using stdio means that your code will run on all
other machines with a standard compliant C compiler, including other 6502
machines.

Being able to port code between the different 6502 machines easily is
important, because all users benefit from it. Especially today, as less and
less new software is being written for the old 8 bit machines, being able to
share code between the platforms is a good method to increase the amount of
available programs.

Yes, it is true that not all programs can be written in C and not all programs
can be written in a portable way. However, a lot of programs can, and from the
remainder, a big percentage could be made portable by separating the non
portable code into small modules that can be rewritten for other machines,
while the major part of the program does not have platform dependencies.

It is also true that cc65 generates larger and slower code than hand tuned
assembly. However, many programs written today are not limited by memory or
speed, but nevertheless most programmers think that they have to write even
simple &quot;hello world&quot; type programs in optimized assembly language.

Many people think that C is a language. While this is true, it is much more
important to notice that C is also a library. And, the library part is usually
much more important than the compiler itself. I've got many mails asking me &quot;I
want to port the cc65 compiler to machine xy, how do I do that?&quot;. The answer
is: You do not need to port the compiler. The compiler generates 6502 code, so
if the target machine has a 6502 CPU, the compiler output will run on this
machine. What has to be ported is the library (at least the system dependent
parts, and I've tried to keep them as small as possible). Until today, a lot
more work was spent on the library than on the compiler proper. So it would be
stupid to throw away all this work and just use the compiler.

Look at Adam Dunkels uip TCP/IP stack for example: It is written in C (with
the exception of the checksuming code), and runs without changes on the C64,
the C128, the Atari, and several other non 6502 platforms. Because the code is
written in C, you can use this code easily for your own projects, improve it
and build on it, similar as you can build on the library that comes with cc65.
It was Isaac Newton who said: &quot;If I have seen further ... it is by standing on
the shoulders of giants.&quot; What he meant was, that he could do new things,
because others had already done quite some work, and he could build on that
work. As I see it, the chances that lie within portable code are currently
underestimated. With a wide range of portable C modules, it would be easier to
write new programs for all platforms, so each piece of portable code is not
only good for itself, but also because it may be the base for other programs,
that would have never been written without this base.

Having no C file I/O is starting to become a limiting factor, even for the
libraries that come with cc65 itself: The next cc65 version will support
loadable modules, which can and will be used as some form of drivers for all
sorts of hardware. You can think of loadable modules as overlays, but these
overlays are relocatable, so they must not be loaded to a specific address. No
C file I/O means that the CBMs won't have loadable modules, at least not
without some ugly workarounds.

Regarding the cbm specific file I/O: While I'm definitely glad that Marc wrote
it , and while I'm using it myself, I consider it as a workaround. Having C
file I/O, there would only rarely be a need to use it, and the C code doing
file I/O would be portable without #ifdef'ing large parts of the code
(remember: the CBM routines are rather low level, you have to add device
communication to read the control channel of the drive and other stuff). Yes,
having standard file I/O would add a few hundred bytes of code. But since file
I/O on the CBMs is slow like hell anyway, the additional CPU time needed is no
problem, and in most cases the additional code will not harm.

&gt; I think one or two people on this list have been hacking away a bit on
&gt; this, sooner or later something might turn up. Until then, use the
&gt; kernal call wrappers and treat the C64 as a C64 :)

Unfortunately I don't have a better advice for now:-)
