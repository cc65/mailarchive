&gt; &gt; Well, I'd say that's the responsibility of the programmer.
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, a programmer does not know which modules from a library
&gt; contain code with these requirements.
&gt;
&gt; I forgot that I did this before, and that there is an easy solution:-)
&gt;
&gt; Just place the code that has to go into low-memory into a special segment
&gt; (which is always the same, regardless of the module). Then, place this segment
&gt; as first segment into the memory area using the linker config.  In fact, this
&gt; approach does exactly the same as your suggestion of &quot;a place at the
&gt; beginning&quot; linker command.  The C128 uses this solution, since the interrupt-
&gt; handler for the RS232 module has to go into low-memory.

When I read the IDE64 Hard-disk Controller's documents, I realized that the C64
target, also, needs to protect interrupt-handlers (for the mouse, too).  Your
solution should be made a standard part of the built-in scripts of all of the
targets.  (Some of the targets might not need to protect a segment, but there
could be common library-routines that want it.)

Perhaps, we can call that segment, &quot;SAFE&quot;.  (It must be &quot;type=rw&quot;.)  Then, we
can go through the entire library, find subroutines that might need that
protection, and put them into &quot;SAFE&quot;.

Another good idea from the C128 ld65-script is the &quot;STARTUP&quot; segment.  It should
be standard, too.  Then, we would not need to name a target's start-up file on
ld65's command-line.  That file could be moved into the library-archive.  When
cc65 sees a definition of main(), it would add a reference to _exit, to force
the linking of that file.
