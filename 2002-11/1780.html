Hello Ullrich,

UvB&gt; Many programs are not really platform specific. Making the plasma demo multi
UvB&gt; platform was not very difficult, the same is true for the fire demo. I do even
UvB&gt; think, I can make it run on the Plus/4 without too much trouble.

well ok, thats true... actually they should all be portable to
platforms with a redefineable characterset (with some lookup-tables
also to regular ascii terminals...ehrm ;=P i'll do that when my 8032sk
is set up hehehe)

&gt;&gt; guess we should define something that works well for everyone ... also
&gt;&gt; some kind of naming sheme for the archives (i'd prefer timestamp over
&gt;&gt; versionnumbers for that matter ;))

UvB&gt; I don't think it makes sense to regulate the directory structure in an
UvB&gt; archive.

well, i like them a way that they dont result in a funny mess when
unpacking more than one of them at once :o) that was the main reason
to ask for &quot;regulation&quot; for them...i am not really sure if its a good
idea to let the (often very unexperienced in our case, many ppl
appearently are learning c by using cc65) user alone with a bunch of
archives with non-organized directories in them which end up into a
non-working clumsy mess when unpacked. also to me its bad practise to
just zip up some source-dir and spread it as an _example_, when you
cant be sure that the thing builts without problems and _unchanged_.
(i have seen M$ visual-crap examples that dont built at all if you
dont fix them first for that matter.... *shudder*)

UvB&gt; The RS232 code could also go into a module. This would have the advantage that
UvB&gt; the hardware could be selected at runtime without linking in all the code.
UvB&gt; However, this is a vision of distant future. I would like to test the driver
UvB&gt; concept using the new graphics API. When this works satisfactorily, it is time
UvB&gt; to think about other areas where modules could be used.

ok, thats true...

UvB&gt; The current snapshot contains the 320*200*2 driver for the C64. The only
UvB&gt; problem is the naming convention. Since there are target platforms with a
UvB&gt; maximum of 6 chars in a filename (+ extension), I've decided to keep my old
UvB&gt; approach only for the source file. So the driver source is named
UvB&gt; c64-320-200-2.s, and is compiled into c64-320-200-2.tgi, but the actual driver
UvB&gt; is later named c64-hi.tgi. The name is important, because one of the
UvB&gt; initialization routines for the graphics can take a constant describing the
UvB&gt; resolution requested. This is then translated into a matching driver name by
UvB&gt; platform specific code. This way, a platform independent program can request a
UvB&gt; graphics mode &quot;320*200, two colors&quot; and will get this mode, if there is a
UvB&gt; driver available.

mmmh just two chars to describe unique modes? thats very little if you
ask me ;=P

also, why put that restriction on a platform that dont need it when
you translate from constants to real filenames anyway? (and also
drivers would only work on one specific platform)

also wouldnt it be smarter to embed the type of resolution (or any
other capabilities) into the module-file so the application really
doesnt need to know which drivers are present? (to me its an important
point that additional drivers can be developed and used even with
applications whose source is not available...and that also means they
cannot be relinked against updated libs that know about new drivers)

UvB&gt; You can take the source of the existing driver as an example. Some of the
UvB&gt; functions are not complete, and there will be minor changes, but the big
UvB&gt; stucture should be in place. The samples directory contains a program named
UvB&gt; &quot;tgidemo&quot;, that shows how to work with the graphics module. To review the API,
UvB&gt; have a look into the tgi.h header file.

perfect, i'll have a look at it.... gotta take a small break from the
retroreplay related stuff anyway (until bugreports come back to me
;=P)... lets see how that works out :)
