&gt; For all others: It's a really nice tetris clone for up to 4
&gt; players 

the number of players is variable and adjusts to the screen size actually....
ie, one tetris playfield is 10 chars wide and as many of them fit on the 
screen will be used! (meaning 2 players on the vic20, 4 on most others, and 8 
players on the PET! yes! :o))

btw never mind the bug that a line sometimes doesnt get cleared immediatly :o) 
i am wondering myself that this works after i slammed it in from memory (did 
sth like that on gbc before :o)) hehe

&gt; written in C and completely conio based (so it should also run on
&gt; the Atari, but as far as I can see this hasn't been tested [hint,
&gt; hint:-)]). You can find it in groepaz' directory:

i gotta say that i personally checked on every (emulated) machine that is 
handled by VICE, so it should run allthrough the cbm-family.... i wouldnt 
doubt that any other target could run it though, nothing fancy in there :)

btw the vic20 conio-library seems to have serious problems with colors and/or 
revers characters..... something seems to be screwed here, couldnt get it to 
work properly with colors (without fixing the lib that is, which i didnt :o)) 

so who is responsible for that part (uz? :=P) and could give me some pointers 
where to look..... and since i know rather nothing about vic20 (it got 
simelar case as c64, less memory, awful sound... now thats it ;=P) i wouldnt 
mind some basic memory map, kernal disassembly etc (the usual crap :o)) 
either, maybe someone hot that laying around....saves me from surfing the web 
and dig through stuff myself :o)

&gt; If supporting 4 joysticks does not need much more code than what is
&gt; currently used, it's ok with me. Otherwise there are always loadable
&gt; modules (this seems to become my standard answer #1:-)

mmh well, both the protovision and my own (dxs&amp;hit) 4-player adapter need some 
more code than usual joysticks do.... however since including all the code 
for all the adapters (there are some more even more obscure ones, including 
the crazy 16-joystick adapater from oliver stiller :o)) i guess those 
loadable modules are the only reasonable solution (we wouldnt want to end up 
with kilobytes of unused joystick-driver code eh? :0))

&gt; BTW: Until now, I've added the following extended memory drivers (==
&gt; loadable modules)
&gt;
&gt;   * C64 + GeoRAM
&gt;   * C64 + REU
&gt;   * C64 hidden RAM under kernal and I/O
&gt;   * C128 + GeoRAM
&gt;   * C128 + REU
&gt;   * C128 memory in bank #1

mmmmh using VDC mem in c64 mode would be major cool.... that would finally be 
a reason to use that one and only acceptable c64 emulator :o))))))))

&gt; Most of the code is not optimized for speed (for example the C128 driver
&gt; for bank #1 calls the FETCH and STASH routines for each byte), but it's
&gt; still reasonably fast, and should be quite useful for sprites, images and
&gt; other stuff. Any feedback is welcome.

copying byte-per-byte should be fast enough for many applications anyway.... 
ie, the action/retroreplay rom does that in many places aswell and you rarely 
notice it. (in monitor disassemble  0-1000 and notice the different speed in 
0400- and 0800- area :o))
