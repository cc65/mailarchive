Hi!

&gt; But removing textcolor() or doing nothing in it leaves the Atari port

&gt; I could add a textluminance() or similar function which does it, but

&gt; function.

Since the Atari is the only platform that has this sort of behaviour, and I
don't think there are many others, textluminance() should be Atari specific.

&gt; Can't we just document the different behaviour of textcolor() for the
&gt; Atari and leave it in so Atari users can set the brightness of the
&gt; text?
&gt; It appears to me to be less hassle this way.

It may be less hassle on the first view, but it would be very short sighted.
If we start having each function behave differently on one or more platforms,
we will effectively undermine the whole portability goal. It is a different
thing for a function to be unavailable on a specific platform, and to behave
differently. Think about it yourself. If bgcolor wouldn't return the old color
on one platform, cputc wouldn't move the cursor on another, cputs wouldn't
interpret a carriage return on a third platform, and gotoxy would measure
coordinates relative to 1/1 instead of 0/0 on a fourth: Even if all these
special behaviours were documented somewhere, it would nevertheless be almost
impossible to write a conio based program that runs on all platforms.

So I would like to ask you to make the necessary changes. The changes (rename
textcolor to textluminance and define textcolor to be an alias for return0) do
not seem to be complex, so if you're busy with other things, I can as well
make these changes. I promise I'll try not to break anything:-)

Please get me right: It is not my intent to cripple the Atari port. Having an
Atari specific function to set the text luminance would be a good idea. But
since this function *is* special, it should be clear to anyone using it, that
it is not portable, and that it does not behave as expected from textcolor().


Regards
