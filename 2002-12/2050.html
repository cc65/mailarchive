This may be true. But it doesn't work, which is a small disadvantage:-)

Here is an example of code that is very common when evaluating key responses:

        switch (cgetc ()) {

            case CH_STOP:
                /* Handle stop */
                break;

            case CH_ESC:
                /* Handle escape */
                break;

        }

This will give &quot;Error: Duplicate case label&quot; on platforms where both keys are
defined to the same value.

&gt; A programmer should not need to wonder if
&gt; a key exists or not -- he simply should use it!  Each implementation &quot;secretly&quot;
&gt; should take care of those &quot;niggling&quot; little details about &quot;Is it there?&quot;, &quot;Where
&gt; is it?&quot;, &quot;How does it look?&quot;, &quot;Should there be a substitute?&quot;, and &quot;What should
&gt; be that substitute?&quot;.

While this is true in theory, and I do share your opinion, there are several
problems that prevent such a solution. Plus, we're mixing several things up in
the discussion, which makes it even more difficult to determine what the real
problem is.

Let me make a list of things to consider:

  1. The only way to &quot;nullify&quot; a key (as with an empty function that does
     nothing), is not to define it. Defining it to an duplicated value will
     give problems as shown in my example above.

  2. Defining a key, even if it does not exist will also give problems. I
     found one of these problems when doing the change for the CH_ESC key. One
     of the minor annoyances with the debugger module was that the routine to
     input numbers or text could not be aborted (at least I thought so). After
     the change, which removed CH_ESC from the cbm.h header file and defined
     it only for machines that do have an ESC key, I found that it is indeed
     possible to abort this function, but the abort key was CH_ESC - which
     does not exist as a real key on the C64. Because CH_ESC was defined, I
     never noticed that.

  3. If we start to globally define keys that do not really exist on some
     platforms, we will quickly run into problems. The CBM-II series for
     example has distinct keycodes for 20 function keys. If we follow the same
     rule as with the escape key that does not exist on some machines, we
     would have to invent replacement key combinations for all these functions
     keys, just to make sure that a program can &quot;just use&quot; them. Consequently
     this would mean that we get the union of all available keys, and we will
     have to invent dozens of replacement key codes for each machine not
     supporting a particular key. This replacement key codes may clash with
     other key combinations, an application might want to use. It is easy to
     see that this cannot be a sound solution.

  4. A big problem in this discussion is that we're mixing up key codes and
     functions assigned to these key codes. This is understandable, since many
     keys are associated with functions (while some others are not), but it's
     not really helpful.

     If we understand the ESC key as the key that produces the escape
     character, instead of thinking of it as an &quot;abort&quot; key, things will
     become clearer. The conio library is very low level, so it should not
     care about key functions, it should just care about key codes. It is the
     job of a higher level library (like MagerValps simplemenu) to assign
     functions to special key codes. The conio library does not know which
     functions are needed by an application, and how they might be
     implemented, so defining an assignment from key code to a specific
     function (for example a &quot;page down&quot; function) will always be
     dissatisfying.

     Now, if we say it's the job of a higher level library to assign functions
     to key codes, it would also be the job of this library to resolve the
     differences between the platforms. Because on this layer, it is known,
     which functions are needed and (mostly) what they do, this is possible
     and will give satisfying results.

  5. Another problem which was introduced by me when doing the first versions
     of the conio library is mixing up keys on the keyboard and character
     codes for output. This led Christian to add something like CH_EOL - a
     name that is understandable if you think about printing something, but
     does not make sense when thinking about character code input.

     While all Commodore machines make use of the escape code when outputing
     characters, some of the do not have an escape key - so this becomes
     confusing if we don't separate the two.

Trying to combine all these things leads to the following possible solution:

  1. Key codes generated on input and characters used for output should become
     separate things. This means that the Commodore machines will have CH_ESC
     (the escape character) but not all of them will have KEY_ESC (the escape
     key).

  2. Defining all possible keys for all possible machines is not a good idea.
     Instead, it is definitely important to know if a machine has a specific
     key or not.

  3. It is the job of a higher level library to assign functions to key codes.
     If within conio key codes for a machine are only defined if a key does
     exist, it is easy for this upper level library to check this define and
     use a replacement. 

Above proposal will give us three separate types of codes:

  1. Output characters:   CH_ESC, CH_HLINE, CH_VLINE

  2. Input key codes:     KEY_ESC, KEY_F1, KEY_F2

  3. Key functions:       KF_ABORT, KF_HELP, KF_SAVE

Only 1. and 2. are defined by conio.

To support writing of portable programs, it may be an idea, to develop some
guidelines, which key codes to use for a program function. This may also help
developers, since many programmers people just know one or two platforms
really well. But, because these guidelines cover a higher layer, they would
not be part of conio.
