Thanks, Uz-

I've just downloaded it. Will definitely try it out.

&gt;     - Completely new graphics library (currently supported: C64) using
&gt;       loadable graphics drivers.
&gt;
This sounds pretty cool. Hopefully the graphics routines are optimized;
I'd hate to do some Q&amp;D inline assembling.

&gt;     - C file I/O support for the following platforms: C64, C128, C16, C116,
&gt;       Plus/4, VIC20, PET. This is probably one of the most requested
&gt;       additions!
&gt;
Yeah! What about GEOS? GEOS is somewhat tricky because it handles disk
access in 256 byte chunks.

&gt;     - New API to access extended memory with loadable drivers for:
&gt;       C64 with GeoRAM cartridge, C64 with REU, C64 using RAM behind kernal
&gt;       and I/O area. C128 with GeoRAM cartridge, C128 with REU and C128 using
&gt;       the RAM in bank #1.
&gt;
What about VICE's REU emulation? It can go up to 16Mb, AFAIK. The API is
designed as not to care about the 2Mb barrier of the REU's?

&gt; There is still no support for the following features:
&gt;   * Floats and bit fields.
&gt;
I'm new to the C language, so please bear with me.

Why hasn't floating point math been in cc65? What are bit fields? Is it
because of the stack? Once someone said that implementing C into assembly
is a 'simple' concept. For example, local variables are stored into the
stack and global variables is stored into RAM. That sounds pretty simple
to me.

However, the stack is only 256 bytes long in the case of the 6502. I'm
assuming that maybe a software stack is used instead. Why not make it
bigger to accommodate floating point math and use ROM routines? Also, how
big is the RAM space reserved for global variables?

Anyway, I'm learning C from a book with an eye on how such a similar C
concept I'm learning would translate into 6502 assembly language. That
way, it'll be easier for me to understand C and maybe contribute a little
to the GEOS effort under cc65.

&gt; There is a mailing list for discussing cc65 related issues (programming,
&gt; suggestions, bugs, ...). See
&gt;
I read some entries in the mailing list. I wonder if it can be searched?
Probably Google can search it, but what about a search just for the
mailing list?

Lastly, I'm developing dotView B0.3 using ca65 and ld65 software. Granted,
this is in 100% assembly, though. I did experience some growing pains
from the transistion of the geoProgrammer assembler used for B0.2 to
the current B0.3 version using cc65 suite. So far I've been impressed
and the transistion is was well worth it. The website for dotView is at:
