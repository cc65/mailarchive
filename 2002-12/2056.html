&gt; &gt;     - Completely new graphics library (currently supported: C64) using

&gt; &gt;
&gt; This sounds pretty cool. Hopefully the graphics routines are optimized;

The C64 driver uses code from Stephen Judd. I'm pretty sure that my code would
be slower:-) However, there's some overhead by the wrappers, and in addition
to that, generic graphic routines as those that come with cc65 can never be as
fast as stuff optimized for a particular use.

&gt; &gt;     - C file I/O support for the following platforms: C64, C128, C16, C116,
&gt; &gt;       Plus/4, VIC20, PET. This is probably one of the most requested
&gt; &gt;       additions!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Yeah! What about GEOS?

GEOS is completely done by Maciej. You can try to bug him:-)

&gt; What about VICE's REU emulation? It can go up to 16Mb, AFAIK. The API is
&gt; designed as not to care about the 2Mb barrier of the REU's?

None of the existing drivers do any parameter checks. One reason is (as usual)
speed and size of the code, another is that in case of the REU driver you can
pass addresses to the driver that are larger than what the driver reports the
REU has, assuming that you know more about the particular REU than the driver.
So no problem here - and also no problem with the REU emulation in VICE.

&gt; Why hasn't floating point math been in cc65?

Because it's a lot of work.

&gt; What are bit fields?

Bit fields are structs or unions with members thats size is specified in bits.
It is not a big omission because several properties of bit fields are non
portable, and access can also be done by using explicit bit shift and masking
operators.

&gt; However, the stack is only 256 bytes long in the case of the 6502. I'm
&gt; assuming that maybe a software stack is used instead. 

This is true.

&gt; Why not make it
&gt; bigger to accommodate floating point math and use ROM routines? 

Because the stack has nothing to do with floating point, and the ROM routines
are not portable.

&gt; Also, how
&gt; big is the RAM space reserved for global variables?

As big as the available memory. You won't be able to add any code if your
global variables eat all your RAM, but the compiler does not care about
that:-)

&gt; I read some entries in the mailing list. I wonder if it can be searched?
&gt; Probably Google can search it, but what about a search just for the
&gt; mailing list?

The web server has no search facility for searching the mailing list but I
remember vaguely that google is able to restrict a search to a specific site.

I will have a look at it, thanks!
