Hi!

Thanks! Someone already posted this here, which led to a fierce discussion
about colors in the Atari text mode:-) As far as I know, groepaz is working
hard on a new, enhanced release, but I don't know how far he has come.

&gt; There is a 8 Joystick adapter for ATARI (that is also supported by ATARI800
&gt; emulator), called Multijoy. I would like to enhance this game to be used with
&gt; this adapter. Is there any existing joystick library supporting more than two
&gt; joysticks for any platform, so that I can make a compatible atari lib?

Thanks for the offer! The problem is that some of the I/O stuff will get
redesigned to use loadable modules, and I don't know if joystick drivers will
be part of that. If joystick drivers get moved to loadable modules, adding
something like the 8 joystick adapter is not a problem. If this stays in the
statically linked library, it means that programs will have to include it at
link time, so they will grow bigger by including all the different drivers -
something that would speak against an additional driver that is rarely used.

Apart from these decisions, the Atari code is mostly maintained by Christian
Groessler, who also wrote the existing joystick code. I would suggest that you
contact him, so you can arrange how to proceed.

&gt; Is there anyone working on tgi or em drivers for ATARI?

As far as I know there is no one working on drivers for the Atari. The TGI
drivers are rather complex because they need to support a full set of graphics
operations (like circles, clipping and so on), but the EM drivers are rather
simple and usually just a few hundred bytes. So if you're thinking about
writing one or the other driver, I would suggest to start with an extended
memory driver and have a look at the existing code (drivers for the C64 and
C128). And, as with all Atari stuff, please check with Christian to avoid
duplicate work.

Regards
