&gt; Thanks! Someone already posted this here, which led to a fierce discussion
&gt; about colors in the Atari text mode:-) As far as I know, groepaz is working
&gt; hard on a new, enhanced release, but I don't know how far he has come.

i'll upload it soon, probably in some days.... i have fixed some bugs from the 
previous release (like before only one line would be cleared, no matter how 
many you completed) and its overall playable, yet not fully complete. 
(hiscore list is missing, no winner displayed at game over etc) i have also 
added support for joysticks, i'd like to replace this by modules though :=)

only serious problem left right now is that we need some kind of timer-api 
that can be used for synchronization. (right now, the thing will run faster 
on faster machines, which is for sure not what we'd want :=))

right now the thing works for all targets supported by cc65 (minus those 
without conio, but i have still prepared some stuff for these). i am unsure 
about the apple2 here, coz' i couldnt get it to work in emulator :=P (maybe 
someone can tell me how to create a working diskimage from the binary using 
the tools that come with the emus :o))

i will also include the 26x25 characters conio for the vic20, plus a 80x25 
conio for the c64 i knocked up years ago for a terminal program that i never 
wrote :=P the latter does work suprisingly well with cc65 (well ofcoz i have 
to say that *G*), it uses the $d000-$ffe8 area for bitmap and data, supports 
colors - and is way faster than the geos-conio for that matter :=) tetris is 
quite playable here hehe :)

actually i am also tinkering with writing a 40x25 conio for the vic20, and 
whatever i can come up with for the NES (provided i can get some damned 
emulator working hehe ;=P)...chances are atleast the one for vic20 will also 
be in the next release (and ofcoz, in the future i will seperate those 
conio-things from 65tris....its just a nice testing ground :=))

&gt; Thanks for the offer! The problem is that some of the I/O stuff will get
&gt; redesigned to use loadable modules, and I don't know if joystick drivers
&gt; will be part of that. If joystick drivers get moved to loadable modules,
&gt; adding something like the 8 joystick adapter is not a problem. If this
&gt; stays in the statically linked library, it means that programs will have to
&gt; include it at link time, so they will grow bigger by including all the
&gt; different drivers - something that would speak against an additional driver
&gt; that is rarely used.

i would really vote for loadable modules here aswell.... i have code for the 2 
most popular 4-player adapters on the c64 ready (needs to be converted to 
loadable module form however) and i would definetly want to be able to use 
them :)

(as a sidenote, i wrote another &quot;driver&quot; for normal joysticks + keyboard 
aswell when i patched bmx-simulator.... that is, conio cant really be used 
for input in a game, since it doesnt support multiple keys pressed at once - 
and additionally on the c64 the keyboard conflicts with the joysticks so you 
have to be smart with choosing the keys and design the keyboard-scanner 
different from the kernal one)
