Hi,

&gt;&gt; If it's ok for you I will put the code into the ATARI readjoy.s,
&gt;&gt; selectable by a &quot;define&quot; (at this time).
&gt;
&gt; Personally, I don't like defines, because they make the code difficult
&gt; to read and to test. But Christian will have to decide this.

Ok, I understand, defines are bad (TM).

&gt;
&gt; If the code is able to distinguish between a machine with and without
&gt; the multi joystick interface, my suggestion would be to do just this and
&gt; accept higher joystick numbers for the readjoy function.

One problem we have to find a solution is that the multijoy needs
initialization. before first use, the 2nd ATARI Joystick port must be
switched into write mode (6 instructions, 15 Byte) the init could be done
every time a joystick is read, but  this is overhead for games.

I'. thinking of an init_joy function. This function can return the number
of joysticks attached, so it's also useful for normal joystick ports. The
init routine could also be used to switch from normal joystick to multijoy
or other input devices. The readjoy function would then read a global flag
set by the init routine and branch to different code.

Games can present a menu for all known Joystick Options available for the
platforms and set the choosen one with the init_joy function accordingly.

After init, the joystick api can be used transparent with any valid number
of joysticks. If the init routine set/change a vector to the joystick
code, the additional cost is one JMP instruction, which is ok even for
games.

Is the use of function vectors supported by cc65? (Sorry if this is a dump
question, I'm not a 'C' wizard)

Only accept higher joystick numbers would not work with every joystick
hardware extension, because, for example, when using multijoy, the code
for reading the 2nd to 4th joystick is differnt than reading from the
build-in joystick device.

&gt;
&gt; Another transparent solution is to enocde the interface into the
&gt; joystick number. For example, the lower nibble could be the joystick
&gt; number while the high nibble could be the type of the joystick. This
&gt; way, we don't have to change the API, just add some additional defines
&gt; in the form
&gt;
&gt;         #define JOY_STANDARD    0x00
&gt;         #define JOY_MULTI       0x10
&gt;
&gt; Both solutions wouldn't need any defines in the sources, which is an
&gt; additional advantage:-)

I fear that this would lead to different &quot;high-nibble-flags&quot; on different
hardware plattforms, so a 8 joystick multiplayer game would not be
(easily) portable from ATARI to, for example C64 Joystrick extensions.

I will work on a proposal and sample source for the &quot;init&quot; solution, which
for my view gives least speed-penalty and no evil defines.

Regards

Carsten
