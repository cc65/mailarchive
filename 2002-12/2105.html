Hi!

Hey, this is great! I've downloaded your patch, applied most of it with a few
changes and fixed/added a few other things:

  * GEOS has its own implementation of revers, no need to add one.

  * The CBM-II series also has a RVS flag which can be used.

  * The lower case mode is stored in the CHARCOLOR variable together with
    some other attributes, so it was the textcolor() function that didn't
    allow the lower case character set to work.

  * The &quot;disable scroll&quot; flag must be set, otherwise the screen scrolls when
    writing to the character in the lower right corner.

I don't have the problem of revers mode being enabled on exit. There may be
some other incompatibilities however, since the output routine will now accept
escape sequences and the like, but I think we can live with that, especially
since the new code is smaller than the old one, because it uses the ROM
routines.

There are a few problems remaining: bgcolor/bordercolor don't work any longer,
and hardcoded screen sizes don't work either.

I've created a new snapshot that contains all the changes if someone is
interested. Unfortunately I have problems with my DSL connection, it was flaky
since noon and now down for most of the last 5 hours. I hope this gets fixed
until tomorrow.

Thanks a lot for this great patch! It will give groepaz more work for his
tetris clone:-)

Regards


        Uz
