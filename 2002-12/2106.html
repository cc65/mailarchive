UvB&gt; Hey, this is great! I've downloaded your patch, applied most of
UvB&gt; it with a few changes and fixed/added a few other things:

UvB&gt; * The CBM-II series also has a RVS flag which can be used.

Where the heck is it? :) I tried disassembling the cbm-ii kernal, but
I couldn't get the vice monitor to work in bank 15. Single stepping
code worked (it followed the code), but it only printed 00 or ff
bytes, making it kinda tricky to figure out what was going on. I also
tried diffing memory (with peek from basic) between $0000..$03ff, but
nothing seemed to change. Frustrating indeed!

UvB&gt; * The lower case mode is stored in the CHARCOLOR variable
UvB&gt; together with some other attributes, so it was the textcolor()
UvB&gt; function that didn't allow the lower case character set to work.

Ohhh. Where is this stored exactly? Is this in the kernal or the cc65
code?

UvB&gt; * The &quot;disable scroll&quot; flag must be set, otherwise the screen
UvB&gt; scrolls when writing to the character in the lower right corner.

K. You added this to initconio or crt0.s?

UvB&gt; I don't have the problem of revers mode being enabled on exit.

OK, good :) Could be an issue with my test program.

UvB&gt; There may be some other incompatibilities however, since the
UvB&gt; output routine will now accept escape sequences and the like, but
UvB&gt; I think we can live with that, especially since the new code is
UvB&gt; smaller than the old one, because it uses the ROM routines.

Right, but escape codes usually does something, I don't think anyone
will be surprised :)

UvB&gt; There are a few problems remaining: bgcolor/bordercolor don't
UvB&gt; work any longer,

Well, they do change the VIC colours, but that's probably not what you
want... Try this:

  <a href="http://www.cling.gu.se/~cl3polof/color.s">http://www.cling.gu.se/~cl3polof/color.s</a>

bordercolor is now a null op when in VDC mode. The other two translate
between VIC and VDC palettes. Note that the VICE VDC emulation is
buggy and doesn't handle register 26 (background colour) correctly.

  ldx #26
  lda #3
  jsr $cdcc
  rts

works just fine on a real 128, but bugs in vice.

UvB&gt; I've created a new snapshot that contains all the changes if
UvB&gt; someone is interested. Unfortunately I have problems with my DSL
UvB&gt; connection, it was flaky since noon and now down for most of the
UvB&gt; last 5 hours. I hope this gets fixed until tomorrow.

Great, I'll base any further work on your snapshot.

Is there any way of submitting patches over CVS instead, or is there
no approve/disapprove funcion in CVS?
