&gt; Where the heck is it? :)

It is at $397 for the CBM 6x0/7x0 series and at $383 for the P500.

&gt; I tried disassembling the cbm-ii kernal, but
&gt; I couldn't get the vice monitor to work in bank 15.

You could have looked into my kernal disassembly for the CBM 610:-) I'm
also preparing a kernal disassembly for the P500, but I haven't worked on it
for a long time now.

&gt; UvB&gt; * The lower case mode is stored in the CHARCOLOR variable
[...]
&gt;
&gt; Ohhh. Where is this stored exactly? Is this in the kernal or the cc65
&gt; code?

The kernal variable at $F1 contains the attributes in the high nibble. Just
setting it to the color will clear all attributes including the second charset
bit.

&gt; UvB&gt; * The &quot;disable scroll&quot; flag must be set, otherwise the screen
&gt; UvB&gt; scrolls when writing to the character in the lower right corner.
&gt;
&gt; K. You added this to initconio or crt0.s?

Neither. I have removed initconio completely and used module constructors
instead, so the scroll flag is now set in the initialization code if the cputc
module is linked into an application.

&gt; Right, but escape codes usually does something, I don't think anyone
&gt; will be surprised :)

I'm not sure if this is really harmless, for example the quote flag is also
set, if a quote character is output. But we'll see once 80 column mode is more
in use. I have adjusted the nachtm sample to use screensize() as a first step.

&gt; Well, they do change the VIC colours, but that's probably not what you
&gt; want... Try this:

Done, thanks!

&gt; Great, I'll base any further work on your snapshot.
&gt;
&gt; Is there any way of submitting patches over CVS instead, or is there
&gt; no approve/disapprove funcion in CVS?

I don't know that approve/disapprove should do. CVS access is possible, but
since CVS is not really secure, and I had problems adding both, read only and
read/write mode, all I can grant is write mode, and for security reasons, I
will allow that only from known IP addresses. If you have a static IP, CVS
access is no problem. 

Regards
