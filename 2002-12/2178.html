&gt; &gt; and other 6502 systems more interested.
&gt; 
&gt; Using C instead of assembly is always a tradeoff: It will add some overhead to
&gt; your programs, but at the same time, development is a lot faster. Because an
&gt; operating system, especially one that does multitasking, is already at the
&gt; limits of the machine, chances are high that the additional overhead will make
&gt; it too large/slow. A second reason was already given by MagerValp: It is not
&gt; possible to write interrupt code or task switching code in C (this is true for
&gt; any C compiler - all operating systems I know have at least a small percentage
&gt; of assembler functions).

I'd like to point out that it actually is possible to write a
multitasker in pure C, but it requires some support from the underlying
system. The GNU portable threads does this by using setjmp/longjmp
together with a special trick using sigaction to set up extra stacks for
the threads. See the following links:

   <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/">http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/</a>
   <a href="http://www.engelschall.com/pw/usenix/2000/pmt-html/">http://www.engelschall.com/pw/usenix/2000/pmt-html/</a>

Futhermore, it might be worthwhile to step away from the unix-style
preemptive multitasking idea, and consider some of the other ways to
achieve multitasking. Non-preemptive multitasking has many advantages,
in particular for smallish systems such as the 6502. It has a lower
context switching overhead and the programs does not have to worry about
preemption and does therefore not have to be reentrant. 

Event based multitasking, where a &quot;task&quot; is defined as a C function that
only runs for a short while, and the scheduler just has to call the
correct C function at the right time, is an alternative that has a very
low overhead. The drawback with this scheme is that certain kinds of
applications (usually those that do long-running computations) are hard
to implement this way. Such applications are quite likely to be uncommon
on the 6502. though :-)

&gt; C support for an operating system would be useful in the higher layers of the
&gt; OS, or in the application layer. The nice thing about C is that it saves a lot
&gt; of development time, so you can do more in the same time. Even if you rewrite
&gt; parts of it in assembler later, there may still be time savings, because the
&gt; assembly code is just a conversion of the working C code, and all algorithms
&gt; are already tested.

I couldn't agree more with the above! :-)

Cheers,

/adam
