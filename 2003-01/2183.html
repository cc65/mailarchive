Hi!

Sorry for the late answer. I will move at the end of january and currently
refurbishing the new flat, so I don't have much time.

&gt; My problem now is, if I try to run the joy-test binary on the ATARI Emulator,

&gt; I need now more information on the cc65 driver architecture, how it works,
&gt; especially on which memory location the drivers are loaded.

cc65 modules are o65 relocatable files as specified in Andre Fachats o65 specs
that are available at

  <a href="http://www.6502.org/users/andre/o65/fileformat.html">http://www.6502.org/users/andre/o65/fileformat.html</a>

Two changes currently not in this document are:

  * There is a new registered ID for cc65 modules

  * There is a new bit in the header (mode.11), which when set means that
    the header has a special &quot;simple&quot; structure, so a few other checks can
    be omitted to keep the loader small.

These changes are &quot;official&quot;, which means that they have been acknowledged by
Andre. It's just the document that is not up to date.

The o65 module loader/relocator which is the base of all higher level loadable
module APIs is described in modload.h (the o65 specs are in o65.h). The module
loader loads the data into space allocated on the heap, does relocation as
needed and clears the BSS segment of the module. This means that the location
of the module can vary.

While the o65 module loader just knows how to load and relocate o65 modules
that have common features like having the cc65 id and the &quot;simple&quot; header bit
set, the higher level code expects a special structure that is described in
the &quot;module.cfg&quot; linker configuration. Each module starts with a header that
is packed into a segment called &quot;JUMPTABLE&quot;. The first four bytes are always a
driver signature (an id and a version number). More data and a jump table for
the functions contained in the driver will follow.

What the higher level API does is this:

  1. Load the o65 module into memory using the o65 module loader. The loader
     will return a pointer to the module.

  2. Check the signature of the driver.

  3. Do some additional checks and/or copy additional data.

  4. Copy the jump table building a cascade of &quot;jmp xxx&quot; instructions which
     jump to the routines in the driver. These jumps are then the actual entry
     points to the driver, which means that the only speed overhead of a
     function contained in a loadable module is one jump instruction.

  5. Call the INSTALL vector of the driver and check the error code.

  6. In some cases: Copy more data that may have changed when calling INSTALL.

In case of the joystick driver, step 3 consists of copying the button masks,
and step 6 does not exist.

The o65 module loader doesn't know about files, the higher level code must
pass a &quot;read&quot; function down. So step 1. consists of opening the file using
open(), calling mod_load(), and closing the file after that. After each step,
the code checks for errors.

Since there were no modules for the Atari before, it may be that there are
problems with the Atari code, or the existing code may not work for the Atari
for unknown reasons. At least in theory, all the platform specific code is in
the open(), read() and close() calls so there is no real reason why the module
loader should not work on the Atari.

The first thing you can try for testing is take the code from
libsrc/joystick/joy_load.c, embedd it into your test program and check the
driver code after it was loaded in memory (before the call to joy_install()).

Next step would be to trace the call to joy_install, maybe changing the
background color in the INSTALL routine of the driver so see if the code is
reached.

Regards


        Uz
