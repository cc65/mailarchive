&gt; So what exactly do you expect none.lib and none.o look like? For the
&gt; former, this is more or less clear, however, many things will not work
&gt; because machine dependent things will be missing. But how should the latter
&gt; look to be usable? And what about the linker config? It assumes that the
&gt; whole address space can be used by the compiled program; an assumption that
&gt; is invalid for most real machines.

none.lib:
should include only the runtime library (required) and some important bits of 
the other libs which might be machine-independent (i would recommend this, 
but its questionable...might be useful to get fileio/conio ports going 
though). it should however be enough to compile any programs that do not call 
any functions :=)
 
none.o:
might not exist, there is probably no good way to have a somewhat &quot;generic&quot; 
version of this, although one could think of a generic one that doesnt setup 
the heap, and thus can work with an &quot;open end&quot; memory modell. this would be 
somewhat like what you get with a minimalistic gcc setup... it would be 
almost independent of the target (except cpu ofcoz, and the start-adress of 
text/bss etc which the user may give on commandline). i know this type of 
setup is very limited (programs cannot use malloc or anything else that needs 
the heap) but its still useful...if the (experienced) programmer chooses to 
not use any c-stylish memory management anyway, and wants to do a lot of 
highly specialised things by hand, that kinda setup may be still sufficient 
to write programs... and its obviously a nice way to get library ports going 
(like i was trying for NES conio)

however, there should be a way to link an alternative &quot;none.o&quot; when the user 
uses &quot;-t none&quot; (currently it looks in the lib dir...probably some commandline 
option would be better)

linker-config:
might also not exist, but probably better be a &quot;linear&quot; modell (like it is) 
with at minimum beeing able to alter the common start-adress from (linker) 
commandline.

at this point it should also be possible to use &quot;-t none -C myown.cfg&quot; to 
instruct the linker to link the none.lib, but use my own linker config.

&gt; What I fear is that once a real &quot;none&quot; target exists, people start
&gt; complaining that it is totally useless for real hardware. And IMHO they are
&gt; right about it.

well, yes and no :) IMHO an option needs to be useable to judge its existance, 
so the question would be making it useable or removing it completely. and
to me a &quot;none&quot; target only makes sence, if it allows to compile programs for 
which no other target exists - else its useless :) 

however, providing a none.o and none.cfg might be a bad idea since that would 
produce non working programs (even without generating an error) and even i 
couldnt bother less about them :=))) but IMHO a minimal none.lib is definetly 
required... ie, writing your own crt0.s and linker-config should be enough to 
get started with a new target...recompiling the runtime library is completely 
unnecessary here. (not to say that its a major annoying thing to do manually 
after each cvs download :=P) [as a sidenote, i would probably generally keep 
the runtime part and the other libraries in seperate .lib archives... that 
would have made this discussion unecessary for a start :=P]

and for the rest of the library, i guess every user should get the idea that a 
&quot;none&quot; target doesnt have stdio or even tgi or whatever :) (i cant think of 
any reason why someone that doesnt know the difference would use the none 
target though :=P)
