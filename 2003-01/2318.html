Hi!

&gt; &gt; I see no real need to do that. The standard says that the #defines are
&gt; &gt; in stdio.h, so anyone using them just has to include this header file.
&gt;
&gt; Doesn't &quot;lseek.s&quot; need to see them in &quot;fcntl.inc&quot;?

Currently only the Atari has an implementation for lseek, and it uses numeric
values. However, for consistency, I would probably add stdio.inc for use with
assembler files.

&gt; We need a prototype for chdir().  (It and rmdir() should be __fastcall__.)

Ok, added.

&gt; Is creat() supposed to return an error-value when the file already exists?
&gt; Or, is it supposed to replace an old file with a new one?

From the Linux manual pages:

       O_CREAT
              If the file does not exist it will be created. [...]

      O_TRUNC 
              If the file already exists and is a regular file and the open
              mode allows writing (i.e., is O_RDWR or O_WRONLY) it will be
              truncated to length 0. [...]

      [...]
      creat is equivalent to open with flags equal to  O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

&gt; &gt; Using fcntl.h is the DOS/Windows way, using unistd.h is the Unix way.
&gt; &gt; Since I didn't expect fcntl.h to grow, and unistd.h suggests Unix
&gt; &gt; compatibility which is not possible, after some discussion,
&gt; &gt; fcntl.h was chosen instead of unistd.h.
&gt;
&gt; Are there any prototypes that traditionally go into unistd.h that you wouldn't
&gt; put into other headers [sleep() and alarm(), for example]?

I'm currently reconsidering the decision that lead to using fcntl.h. When
using fcntl.h, I didn't realize that it would contain a larger number of
function prototypes. Now it seems that more and more functions pop up that
would fit into unistd.h. I don't have much time currently to work on cc65,
this will change some time in february. Until that time, I have no chance than
to add that topic to my ever growing TODO list:-)

Regards


        Uz
