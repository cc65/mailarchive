&gt; How hard would it be to add the Lynx as a target for cc65 (again?) ?

This version of cc65 never had a lynx target. There was another version based
on the old Atari cc65, developed independently by Bastian Schick, which
generated code for the lynx exclusively. It hasn't been updated for years,
however. Problem with that version is that most library routines are rather
non standard and lynx specific.

I don't know how much effort would be neeed for a lynx port. For a machine I
know, it's usually a few hours to get the first program running with a few
simple library routines (kbhit/cgetc and maybe cputc). The total effort needed
is difficult to estimate for me, because I don't know the lynx. As usual the
real work is writing the necessary library routines.

&gt; What would the issues be, if any?

If you're planing to contribute support for the lynx, please don't use any
code from the existing lynx compiler (license problems). Try to support
existing APIs and don't invent anything new if this is not absolutely
necessary. The minimum needed is a linker configuration and a startup file.
With these two it is possible to compile programs, but since there's no I/O
they are of not much use (the Atmos target is currently in this state). While
writing the linker config and startup is quite easy (a few minutes if you know
the machine), I would prefer to have a more complete port. I had added such a
minimal configuration several times but never got anything else, so I removed
the stuff later on.
   
In addition to that, the usual rules apply (<a href="http://www.cc65.org/#PatchPolicy">http://www.cc65.org/#PatchPolicy</a>).
