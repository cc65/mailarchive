I apologize for being off topic, it hadn't occurred to me that this
was not a topic to be asked here. I realize now that this question was not
a cc65 compiler specific question.

Thanks for the suggestion of $F704. I was unable to use $F704 to resolve
the problem regardless of the bit configuration in $9B (modified by the
setmsg kernal routine). I've spent two days trying to resolve the issue,
so I'll simply include a BRK instruction in the event of a file not being
found. It isn't that important of an issue.

Could anyone direct me to a forum where C64 specific programming questions
would be on topic? I already have all the docs I've found online plus my
original C64 Programmer's Reference Guide and two assembly language books
for the C64. I will be using cc65 C for the game I am working on, I just
had to use assembly to make the auto-loader. I'm making a C64 version of a
game called &quot;Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland&quot; that I just played on a
Playstation 2 recently... :)

Thanks. :)

&gt;
&gt; This is slightly off-topic. Anyway, using the kernal routine at $F704 should
&gt; do what you want (provided that operating system messages are enabled - check
&gt; bit 6 in $9D).
