<pre>
I've just finished the first beta version of an object code conversion
utility. This utility converts o65 files into the native object code format
used by the cc65 tool chain (in fact it generates assembler files that must be
translated by ca65).

The converter allows (among other things) to link drivers to an application
that must otherwise be loaded at runtime. This means that you can now link
graphics or joystick drivers to your executable, if you don't like the
overhead of the o65 module loader and don't need the additional flexibility.
Or, you can choose to link the most commonly used drivers statically (standard
joystick for example) while allowing to load others at runtime.

This does also mean that platforms currently lacking disk I/O can now use the
same driver format. Until disk I/O is available, drivers can be linked
statically. Once disk I/O (maybe in simulated form) is available, the same
drivers may also be loaded at runtime.

Using the converter, it should also be possible to link object files generated
by other development tools to executables generated by ld65. However, this has
not been tested, so I won't guarantee anything.

As always feedback is greatly appreciated. I've written a preliminary doc file
containing an example of how to create a program that uses a statically linked
tgi driver. Please have a look at this doc file if you want to give the
converter a try.
                                                    
Please note: Technically speaking you can use this utility with version 2.9.0
of the compiler. However, the driver APIs in this version lack calls to use a
driver that is already loaded into memory, so while you can link the driver to
your application, you cannot make use of it (at least not with the old APIs).
So as always, please use the snapshot if you want to use bleading edge
technology:-)

Regards


        Uz
