Excellent. I used the first suggestion, although the 2nd suggestion works
like a charm. When you call the kernal LOAD routine and encounter an
error, the .C register is set and the .A register contains the error
code. To print out the disk error message and return to basic, add the
following code to a routine somewhere after the kernal LOAD call before
you change the value in the .A register:

	tax			; transfer kernal error code to .x
	jmp	($0300)		; jump to basic warm start

This method also handles messages for &quot;DEVICE NOT PRESENT&quot; and other
possible disk errors. Thanks for the help Uz... :)

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the suggestion of $F704. I was unable to use $F704 to resolve
&gt; &gt; the problem regardless of the bit configuration in $9B (modified by the
&gt; &gt; setmsg kernal routine). I've spent two days trying to resolve the issue,
&gt; &gt; so I'll simply include a BRK instruction in the event of a file not being
&gt; &gt; found. It isn't that important of an issue.
&gt;
&gt; Two more suggestions:
&gt;
&gt;         ldx     #$03
&gt;         jmp     ($300)          ; Prints &quot;FILE NOT FOUND&quot;, reenters BASIC
&gt;
&gt; and
&gt;
&gt;         jmp     $E19C           ; Prints &quot;LOAD ERROR&quot;, reenters BASIC
&gt;
&gt; Please note that in both cases, the $300 vector may have been modified by your
&gt; autoloader, so you have to check that.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Could anyone direct me to a forum where C64 specific programming questions
&gt; &gt; would be on topic?
&gt;
&gt; As far as I know, the CBM Hackers mailing list is more appropriate for
&gt; questions like these (the list is not C64 specific). I'm subscribed to that
&gt; list, and there are a lot of interesting discussions going on, but I cannot
&gt; remember how I subscribed to that list, so unfortunately I cannot tell:-) You
&gt; may want to use Google to search for the subscription address and policy.
