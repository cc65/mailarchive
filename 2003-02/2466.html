Hi!

This night, I had a new idea regarding loadable drivers (as you can see, my
problem is not a lack of ideas:-)

  1. We have loadable drivers.

  2. We can link these drivers statically by converting the o65 object files
     into the native object file format.

Now, how about adding precompiled and already converted versions of the
drivers to the library, so one can link in the drivers without any hassle by
just calling xx_install()? This would blur the line between loadable and
static drivers and make it easier for beginners to get started.

One problem I'm facing here are the naming conventions of the drivers. While
the long names are really descriptive, they are too long, even for the CBMs
which have a 16 character file name limit. On the other side, having different
names for the driver sources and the loadable drivers has shown to be
confusing, at least for me. Having more files for one driver (o65 converted to
assembly, and the native object code version of the driver ready to get
statically linked) will make this problem even worse.

Does anybody have comments, suggestions or maybe even a complete solution for
the naming problem?

Regards


        Uz
