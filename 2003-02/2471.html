&gt; I got an idea of this type too:  :)
&gt;
&gt; Ok, this is a weird idea, but what about a hash-function: a function, where
&gt; you put in the long names and then pops out the short names...
&gt; Or what about compression: just &quot;zip&quot; the long names (in contrast to the
&gt; first method this works in both directions).
 
something else that goes into a simelar direction....

1) we could define certain types of drivers to have a certain unique 
extension, ie joystick==.joy graphics==.tgi etc (this is already the case)
2) we forget about filenames that are the same on all _targets_ alltogether. 
we use long names in the source, and make up whatever filename we like for 
the target. the idea is, that if only one driver exists it can be either 
statically linked or loaded with a wildcard (&quot;*.joy&quot;). if more than one 
driver exists, the user would need to select one of them (this could be 
autodetection aswell, but simelar things apply here) in one way or another. 
at this point on a target that allows very short filenames only, sth like 
&quot;abc4prt.joy&quot; doesnt quite tell the user what he really wants to know. so
3) we embed a short description (mayb 10 or 20 chars or so) into the driver 
binary, preferably right at the start of it. then with a little modified 
loader for the driver we could read this information and show for the 
user...ie, with simple dir-scanner (&quot;*.joy&quot;) we could list all modules' 
descriptions easily (this is all we really want, else why wouldnt we even 
talk about those filenames? :=)), and the filenames wouldnt matter at all.

just an idea :)

oh and as you mention packing... one could probably more or less easily 
implement a depacker for say, exomizer or pucrunched files for atleast 
loadable modules...its questionable though if packing files that are this 
short (~1 or 2 blocks) makes a lot of sence at all...maybe simpliest rle that 
takes not more than a fraction of that for depacker doesnt even work well 
here, since code typically doesnt pack well in terms of rle.
