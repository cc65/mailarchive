&gt; 3) we embed a short description (mayb 10 or 20 chars or so) into the driver
&gt; binary, preferably right at the start of it. then with a little modified
&gt; loader for the driver we could read this information and show for the
&gt; user...ie, with simple dir-scanner (&quot;*.joy&quot;) we could list all modules'
&gt; descriptions easily (this is all we really want, else why wouldnt we even
&gt; talk about those filenames? :=)), and the filenames wouldnt matter at all.

This could be an o65 option (the o65 object file format allows to embedd
options of different kind in the object file). The advantage of using an
option is that options aren't loaded into memory because they aren't part of
the relocatable code. The idea sounds reasonable, I will have to talk with
Andre about adding a new option (&quot;o65 description&quot; or similar). But he seems
to be busy with other things, he hasn't even updated the o65 spec regarding
the new cc65 id and the new flags bit (&quot;simple addressing mode&quot;).

However, this doesn't solve my naming problem. While having different names
sounds good on the first glance, my experience with the current solution for
the c64 tgi drivers is, that it is more confusing than helpful - at least for
me as a developer, because I'm constantly mixing up the names.

&gt; oh and as you mention packing... one could probably more or less easily
&gt; implement a depacker for say, exomizer or pucrunched files for atleast
&gt; loadable modules...its questionable though if packing files that are this
&gt; short (~1 or 2 blocks) makes a lot of sence at all...maybe simpliest rle that
&gt; takes not more than a fraction of that for depacker doesnt even work well
&gt; here, since code typically doesnt pack well in terms of rle.

I don't think that the size on disk is a problem, since the memory footprint
is the actually limiting factor. BSS space is already virtual (that is: not
contained in the o65 file), so an RLE packer wouldn't give really good
performance, because all that is left is initialized data and code.
