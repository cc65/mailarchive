&gt; Is it possible that you have sometimes problems finishing things? :-)

yes :o) also continueing them once they are started :=P there are just to many 
interisting things that could be done... :O) (guess why i have worked with 
that many machines/computers/consoles/etc) :) the only thing i am really good 
at is quickly knocking up stuff from nothing and make it work. (i share that 
habit with most guys in our group though :=P ...the debug-hardware we made 
for the dreamcast is prime example...spend ~1year to have a working debugger, 
spend another year to knock up a base library and port gcc...then be bored 
and never actually use those tools to create a decent demo :=P)

&gt; I've seen quite some code from you, and a lot of really good stuff (the
&gt; graphic demos that come with cc65 are an example), but the last tedious 10%
&gt; that make a software package ready for distribution do not seem to be your
&gt; thing. Teaming up with someone else who is good in this part would probably
&gt; help.

hehe.... i think my major problem is that i can't stand releasing things that 
i think could be still improved.... and since we all know that a certain 
software can always be improved....etc :O)

for example.... there are a whole bunch of files in tetris now which i have 
taken from the cc65 libs (as a template) and then modified (for nes,pce 
etc)... one thing i didnt bother modifying was the copyright info in them... 
now there are tons of files which are basically finished (and could be 
released) but i dont really like to do it in their current state.... args, 
and since its way more interisting to code than to clean up info...it will 
take some more time probably. (and seriously, i dont think anyone would team 
up with a coder who just wants him to do the boring slave work :=))

if someone would be seriously interisted in doing packaging, test-builts, 
proofreading etc pp.... i wouldnt mind (in turn, i dont really mind quickly 
knocking up some stuff for other ppl either... hehe)

ohwell...we'll see :=P &quot;most programmers have the tendancy to spend 90% of 
their time on a detail that makes 5% of the actual problem&quot; :=)
