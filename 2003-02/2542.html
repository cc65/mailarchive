&gt;&gt; The lynx's screen is not tile based.  The screen display is just a section
&gt;&gt; of memory (anywhere you point it) 8160 bytes long, and there is dedicated
&gt;&gt; sprite hardware that can draw an unlimited amount of sprites into this
&gt;&gt; area.  I'm just porting Bastian Schick's code to work with Ullrich's
&gt;&gt; version of cc65 (which doesn't require much work really) and he already has
&gt;&gt; a textout function for an 8x11 and a 8x8 font (both of which I've ported
&gt;&gt; already and they work.)
&gt;
&gt;oh cool.... should be easy enough to create conio compatible stuff from it 
&gt;then :)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I was thinking about your 65tris and possibly trying to get it working on
&gt;&gt; the lynx... that would be a good way to learn more about the system (for
&gt;&gt; me.)
&gt;
&gt;would love to see that :)

The only problem being that I don't have permission from the original author to rerelease his code in a modified form.  I haven't seen any license information that says that is possible... so until/unless I contact the orginal authors and get their permission to release their (ported by me) library code for others to use, I would be the only one who could compile it.  I believe I could release binaries created with their library, but that isn't much good to you.

Better to wait until others (such as Christian Kruger) have finished their work on a real lynx target I think.
