Some &quot;technician&quot; at my ISP has choosen to enable NAT on the DSL router
yesterday late in the evening. They didn't tell me who he was, but I hope they
will fire him. This action has made incoming connections to any services in my
network impossible. The customer hotline was just able to write down my
complaints and pass them to some other technicians, who could not locate the
backup of the saved router configuration, were not able to see any problem,
could not tell what was wrong, and didn't call me back. I had to severely
escalate the situation until they forced someone to stop playing Minesweeper
and call me back to fix the router. Total downtime: 17 hours.

&gt; I looked at coding tips, hence the use of unsigned ints :)  There maybe
&gt; one or two other places I could omptimize in the tight loop.

Moving the local variable declarations out of the inner blocks will give a
noticeable speedup. More speedups are possible by remembering values instead
of recalculating them.
