Hi,

&gt; [...]
&gt; [C++]
&gt; &gt; Or why is it possible to declare a destructor 'non-virtual'?
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; Because it is not always necessary - if you don't inherit 
&gt; your classes.
&gt; There are times where this is usefull.

I know that, you know that and the linker should know that too. So
why I have to give that hint to the linker/compiler? (The same is true
for the 'call-by-value' &amp; 'call by const ref.'-issue...)

The whole concept of having RTTI or not is for beginners confusing
and for experts a waste of thoughts and should be hidden by the
development tools. When somewhere is a 'dynamic cast', the compiler
should notice that, and should automatically assign the base class
a virtual function table etc.
And if there are some 'features' which could not done without
speed loss, than they have to be done with speed loss. When I have
to write fast code, I can use an other language and maybe should not
use the C stuff with classes. C++ is a bad mixture, it isn't clean, plain
&amp; transparent. It is neither fish nor fowl.

&gt; In fact, you can use C++ as a &quot;C enhanced&quot; when you restrict yourself
&gt; to the things that don't have much speed and/or size drawbacks. If you
&gt; make sure that the run-time system reflects these limitations, C++ is
&gt; nothing more than a more handy C-variant. There are some 
&gt; efforts in this
&gt; area, I think one of them is called &quot;embedded C++&quot;.

I have to disagree. C++ is not only a question of size and speed.
It's also a question of comfort. There are many things which could
be done by the compiler &amp; linker that are 'out-sourced' to the
programmer.
Another example: There is no technical restriction which makes it
impossible to call a virtual function out of a constructor if the
virtual function restricts member access to base class members
(avoiding access to 'not-yet-constructed-members'). In some cases
where I need such feature I have to implement 'wild things' to get
the desired behaviour...
Or 'exception handling': I can declare that a function throws
an exception but it isn't checked if there is any 'catch'. This
should lead to a compiler/linker-error...

Sorry for beeing so off topic. I know, my comments don't change
the world, but it helps to let the 'steam' out... ;-)

Regards
chrisker
