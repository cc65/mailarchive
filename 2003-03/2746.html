&gt;Yesterday evening I've browsed the web with my Atari for the 1st time :-)

Did you ever think you would with an Atari 8-bit? :)

&gt;The current version loads at $2000 and uses memory up to $BAE4 (stack at
&gt;$BC1F). So it doesn't work for e.g. Atari DOS 2.5 (lowest address
&gt;available $244C with 4 drives), SpartaDOS works ($1FC0; addresses with R:
&gt;handler for 850 loaded).

I was thinking that some sort of 80 column driver could be implemented, but I forgot that we need to load an R: handler.  Maybe on of the flickering Gr.0 types... 8k for a Gr.8 screen is probably too much (unless you use a 130XE and tell ANTIC to grab the screen from out of expanded memory, but then you lose compatiblity with all other machines.)

&gt;I'm now looking into using some tiny loader DOS
&gt;(MyPicoDOS, <a href="http://www.horus.com/~hias/atari/">http://www.horus.com/~hias/atari/</a>) where it could be loaded at
&gt;$700 (w/o R: handler). But MyPicoDOS cannot yet load both the R: driver
&gt;and then the contiki app. So I think I'll try to modify MyPicoDOS to load
&gt;the R: driver by itself (should give some final load address at around
&gt;$DC0 for contiki).

With these mini-loader DOSes, will cc65 file i/o routines work?

&gt;Another idea is to get more memory by loading the 800 (not xl) BIOS into
&gt;RAM which should make the area $C000 to $D000 available (not used by this
&gt;BIOS), giving another 4k of RAM.

That would cut off some hardware from being used with Contiki (PBI hard drives.)  Maybe that's not an issue.

&gt;If you're ready to compile your own version, I can send you my diffs for
&gt;contiki-1.0.

Thanks, but I'll wait until you've got something a little more configurable and complete.  I'm glad you are working on this, Christian!

&gt;&gt; Once its done, I'd be interested in programming some apps/utils for it!  Looks very 
&gt;neat.
&gt;
&gt;The memory is very tight on the Atari, so it's not that straightforward...

Maybe we would have to implement some type of application swapping to extended memory.  Also not everyone is going to want to run the http server, web browser, telnet client, email, etc...  It would be better to implement these things as loadable modules and let the user load which ones they wanted until they fill up memory.
