Hi,

thanks for all the comments!

&gt; Anyway, I'd opt for having only one driver at a time, but with option for more
&gt; than one port (two for simplicity). E.g. only DUART on IDE64 or only 16551
&gt; (AFAIR it has two ports) or only two 6551s (at different I/O base addresses).

Passing a port number to the driver is exactly what causes the overhead
described in my last mail. So if I want to avoid the overhead, I have to

  * either drop the option for multiple ports,

  * or find another solution for passing the port number.

And as a sidenote: The 16551 has one just port, but there are similar and more
modern chips that have more ports, larger FIFOs and higher baud rates.

Good point. I would hate to introduce overhead that doesn't give any benefits
for almost 100% of all applications.

&gt; Since I mentioned the Apple ][, and since the Apple ][ generally uses
&gt; smart serial ports and since there appears to be no rs232 support in the
&gt; cc65 libraries for the Apple ][, does the Apple ][ case need to be
&gt; considered?

Of course I could ignore the Apple (or other machines) when making decisions
that have a considerable impact. But it's not a good idea. The goal of making
the RS232 driver a module is to

  * simplify writing drivers,

  * allow third parties to supply drivers for special hardware,

  * allow program authors to support hardware that isn't even known when
    the program gets written, and

  * to allow users to replace/add drivers, so new hardware can be used with an
    application without special application support.

As you can see, the concept of loadable drivers contains nothing that is
machine specific. So it's a good idea to at least consider the capabilities of
all supported machines to avoid ruling out something that may limit someone
later.

&gt; It also seems that if the libraries for the Apple][ could allow 2 (or
&gt; more) instances of the drivers could be loaded or the multiple support
&gt; be implemented in the Apple ][ library, then the problem is reduced to a
&gt; specific architecture.

There won't be any special Apple libraries besides the actual driver. If you
look at the existing libraries, you will notice that the machine dependent
library parts are as small as possible. While this needs more brain work when
doing the design, it has several advantages:

  * The differences between the platforms are minimized, so porting programs
    between platforms becomes easier.

  * Less code has to be written, tested and maintained. I'm no longer able to
    test the complete library, simply because I don't have the knowledge about
    the different platforms, the hardware or whatever. If most of the code is
    shared between the platforms, the chance to break one specific platform
    library is quite small, because most of the code is tested when testing
    another platform. If one platform has a huge platform specific library,
    chances are that some change elsewhere breaks this library without anyone
    taking notice.

What this means is that any feature that is not in the API now, may not be
supported by any of the platforms later. If the serial API doesn't support
more than one port at the same time, this is true for *all* platforms.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I do agree with Maciej that higher port speeds are more important than support
for more than one port. So what I will do now is to allow just one driver with
support for one port. From what was said, it is clear that passing a port
number to the get and put functions has too much overhead, so another solution
is needed. The only other solution with almost zero overhead I can see now is
to add separate functions for the different ports (for example rs232_get2,
rs232_put2). Fortunately, adding a second port in this way will not break
existing code, so this can be added later if necessary.

Thanks again for your comments!

Regards


        Uz
