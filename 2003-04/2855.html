Hi!

&gt; As Groepaz said, i did conio lib friday. Groepaz was trying to compile his
&gt; tetris with my conio.s.

I didn't know that, sorry.

&gt; &gt;   * A clock() function. It is 16 bit only, and I don't have an idea, which
&gt; &gt;     value CLOCKS_PER_SEC should take, so there's room for improvements.
&gt;
&gt; I'll try to see

Seems that I found it: The software timers are decremented each 10ms, so
CLK_TCK is 100.

&gt; &gt;   * Colors. If you thought, colors on the Atari are weird, please have a
&gt; &gt; look at the Oric. Colors are *really* crazy on this platform.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Yes that is why i said that it's difficult to have common libs for atmos

I don't think it was difficult, but I had to leave off the additional
functionality, the Oric provides for colors. I'm currently supporting 40x28 in
black/white. If necessary, it would also be possible to reduce this to 38x28,
to allow at least some support for colors outside of what conio can support.
I'm not sure which one is better.

&gt; Please see that for informations:
&gt; <a href="http://www.defence-force.org/computing/oric/coding/part_7/index.htm">http://www.defence-force.org/computing/oric/coding/part_7/index.htm</a>

Most of this information is also in my &quot;new&quot; book (&quot;Oric Atmos and Oric 1 -
Graphics and Machine Code Techniques&quot; by Geoff Phillips).

&gt; Well this tap header is really the real header for real machine (When you load
&gt; from a tape, it's really this header). If you use a disk controller, you have
&gt; to remove this header.

Xeuphoric seemed to require this header, so I thought it would be convenient
to add it. I had to dig around a little to get more information on how the
header is built, but now it's pretty easy to load programs into the emulator.

&gt; PS : I am doing atomic (katomic a linux game) with cc65 on the Oric.. so
&gt; please don't say me tomorrow that you did it this night :-P

Ok, noted:-)

Regards


        Uz
