&gt; So, in my first segment I *have* to have my code segment first and my bss segment last, unless I want to have my own crt0.s file, which I don't since then I have to keep updating my code with library changes (I think there were two major upgrades to the atari library during the writing of my application.)  Thus my heap area is stuck in this small memory area (2000-3FFF) as well (?)

The builtin linker configurations and the existing crt0 modules are not
thought to handle each and any possible memory configuration. Your case (two
distinct memory areas) is a good example for a situation where it is ok to use
a changed crt0 and linker config. I see your point in regard to changes in the
libraries, but there's nothing I can do to prevent that. Changes may occur
because the compiler and the libraries develop, even if I try to keep the
impact low. You can avoid problems in this area by not upgrading the compiler.

&gt; I thought if you could make this more easily configurable it would be nice (in a separate thread you said that wasn't possible though.)

It is possible but it's quite some work, and this is definitely not high
priority. There is a solution for your problem: Use your own crt0 and linker
config. It's just somewhat inconvenient. But as long as there are other things
that need to be solved that do not even work now, the &quot;somewhat inconvenient&quot;
things have to wait.

BTW: There are some things in the crt0.s file for the Atari that could get
removed and packed into constructors/destructors making the file smaller and
not so dependent on library changes. Christian is your man for this:-)
