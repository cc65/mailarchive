&gt; &gt; as for the dual drives...well, this can not be the reason for not doing things
&gt; &gt; like i said above :) invent something to handle cbm dual drives then, dont
&gt; &gt; pollute the whole thing with this rather exceptional stuff :) (the same is
&gt; &gt; true for stuff like handling subdirectories...if its machine dependend, its
&gt; &gt; not very useful IMHO)
&gt; 
&gt; As I said, my original idea was to use drive:filename, so I could live with
&gt; that. Unfortunately, the CBM drives do *require* a drive number (the internal
&gt; one), at least according to my docs. Otherwise two data channels are allocated
&gt; instead of one, which limits the number of files that can be open at once.
&gt; This is even true for single disk drives, because the ROMs are derived from
&gt; the dual disk drive versions.

How about &quot;[device:][drive:]name[;version]&quot;, i.e., with optional device
and drive numbers? The test for if a drive: is present would be quite
simple as well: if(name[1] == ':' &amp;&amp; isdigit(name[0]));

&gt; It is, in one way, dangerous to have too many ideas. There must be a balance
&gt; between your ideas, and your ability to implement them. Having too many ideas,
&gt; you will run into danger, never to implement something usable, because what
&gt; you are doing is always under construction. You will also run into danger to
&gt; change your APIs so often, that no one is actually able to use them.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, not having any ideas isn't a good idea either:-)
&gt; 
&gt; Since file I/O and the extended memory subsystem are brand new, and there is
&gt; not a single program I've heard of, that uses the latter, I would suggest just
&gt; to wait some time and see what people are actually doing. In my experience,
&gt; this is a good way to learn what is really needed and to have all necessary
&gt; features in an API while at the same time keep it as minimalistic as possible.

Speaking of ideas and extended memory; I indend to make use of this for
Contiki (some kind of generalized caching... I have a few ideas ;-). The
extended memory stuff is really quite cool in any case.

Speaking of IRQ-loaders: some kind of synchronous serial I/O protocol
loader would definately be needed for the C64 version of Contiki, as the
CBM kernal based file I/O breaks with the NMIs caused by the
RS232/SwiftLink... I personally think that Uz' suggestion with a
loadable module that patches the kernal vectors sounds like a nice
solution.
