&gt; &gt; mmmh... maybe i'm just overlooking something....but isnt there a way to
&gt; &gt; tell ld65 an additional path to search for library files? it seems to me
&gt; &gt; that the way it is i would either to have my own library installed at the
&gt; &gt; same place as cc65 does (dont like this) or give a full path to the
&gt; &gt; library when linking (better, but still not very convinient). i wouldnt
&gt; &gt; mind a commandline switch simelar to -I here (-L seems to be common in
&gt; &gt; other linkers).
&gt;
&gt; Ok, noted:-)

:O)

just noticed another little problem (i'm preparing my &quot;portlib&quot; stuff for 
contiki etc :=))

for the include search path it would be nice to be able to explicitly state if 
the path given is searched before or after the builtin/default search path. 
(the same is true for the library search path but its probably much less of a 
potential problem here).

the &quot;portlib&quot; i am writing targets not only cc65-supported machines, and it 
mimics the cc65 api for those that cant be supported by cc65 directly 
(because they have different cpu ofcoz :=)).

in my portlib's &quot;include&quot; directory there are header-files with the same names 
as those supplied by cc65, for example &quot;conio.h&quot;. however there are (or may 
be) also header files which are not supplied by cc65, so this 
include-directory is added to the include-search-path also for cc65-supported 
machines.

now the problem is, if i include eg &quot;conio.h&quot; in my program and compile it for 
a cc65-supported target, cc65 will look in my portlib's include directory 
first, and find and use the conio.h presented there... and there is no way to 
make it use the conio.h supplied by cc65 except for crude thinks like using 
full pathes when including, or even renaming one of both files.

in other words, currently any user-supplied header file will override (found 
before) any header file supplied by cc65. what i need is the opposite, cc65 
header files override (found before) any user defined headers.

maybe the latter could also be simply made the default... i dont see any bad 
side-effects atleast. (except that it kinda forces ppl not to have their 
headers named like those supplied by cc65...which isnt really a bad thing per 
se :=))
