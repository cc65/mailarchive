Unfortunately you haven't given enough information for me to track down the
problem. Some things you say seem to contradict each other. One example is
that the EXEHDR segment is added in one situation and not in the other. This
is almost impossible. Why should the linker do that? Another thing I don't
understand is: if the non working code is being compiled and used on a Linux
system, how comes that your compile and link scripts are windows batch files?

If you used the Linux system to just recompile the libraries and the final
application compile happened on a Windows system, one possible cause is that
you messed up the libraries/object files or the executable when transfering
them. Windows has a lot of old and quite illogical behaviours, one being that
there is a difference between text and binary files. Some tools apply
automatic conversions to files when transfering them between machines. A
binary file that gets transferred in text mode will get corrupted when doing
so.

My suggestion would be to run the binary on the Linux system if you haven't
done so before. Development under Linux (or other Unices) is a lot easier and
straightforward than under Windows, and a lot of problems simply don't exist.

If the above is *not* the cause of your problem I need more information about
what you did *exactly*. Which packages are you using? Which files/tools and
command lines were used for the original (working) binary and which were use
for the non working one? On which systems did each step happen and if more
than one system was involved, how did you transfer the files? Did you compare
the transfered files resp. output files byte by byte? If so, how do they
differ? If you didn't: Linux comes out of the box with tools that can do that
easily. If you're using Windows, things are worse, so see my suggestion above.

Regards
