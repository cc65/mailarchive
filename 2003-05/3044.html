Hi!

&gt; Copying that new program (through samba

Just to be sure about that cr/lf problem: When copied to the windows box,
does the program have the same size as before (on the linux box)?

&gt; The
&gt; binary built on linux looks correct in the emulator but the function
&gt; calls jump to the wrong place.

Which archives (versions) were you using and where did you get them from?

&gt; For example: the zerobss call,  on both
&gt; binaries (the windows and the linux)  the JSR is to EEB but that
&gt; location is 4 bytes short it should be to EEE.
&gt;
&gt; Its almost like the EXEHDR is messing things up.  It it 4 bytes long.

$EEE - $EEB = $003. If it were really the EXEHDR segment that is missing, you
wouldn't get 3 byte offsets.

&gt; Am I forgetting some type flag somewhere ??

I don't think so. Compiling the sources and the libraries is straight forward
and a lot of people are doing it. There have been a few cases where people
reported similar problems, but in each case the problem has been caused by
passing intermediate or final binary files through a tool that didn't handle
binary files correctly.

If the above test fails (all binaries have the same size), can you send me the
output files in private mail?

Regards


        Uz
