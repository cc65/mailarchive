&gt;Hi!
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the detailed description. I'm sorry that I didn't note this
&gt;earlier, but the linker acts exactly as it should. Have a look at the
&gt;linker configuration for the Apple (this file is part of the source
&gt;package and comes in the doc/ directory of the apple2 binary package):
&gt;
&gt;    MEMORY {
&gt;        ZP: start = $00, size = $1A, type = rw, define = yes;
&gt;        HEADER: start = $0000, size = $4, file = %O;
&gt;        RAM: start = $800, size = $8E00, file = %O;
&gt;    }
&gt;    SEGMENTS {
&gt;        EXEHDR: load = HEADER, type = ro;
&gt;        STARTUP: load = RAM, type = ro, define = yes;
&gt;        LOWCODE: load = RAM, type = ro, optional = yes;
&gt;        CODE: load = RAM, type = ro;
&gt;        RODATA: load = RAM, type = ro;
&gt;        DATA: load = RAM, type = rw;
&gt;        BSS: load = RAM, type = bss, define = yes;
&gt;        ZEROPAGE: load = ZP, type = zp;
&gt;    }
&gt;
&gt;What you can see is that the AppleDOS 3.3 header which comes in the EXEHDR
&gt;segment is written into the HEADER memory area, which goes to the output
&gt;file (&quot;%O&quot; is the output file named on the command line).
&gt;
&gt;The STARTUP segment, which contains the code from crt0.s is the first
&gt;segment that is written to the RAM memory area, which is relocated to $800
&gt;and which goes into the same file as the header.
&gt;
&gt;This means that the output file contains 4 bytes of header, followed by
&gt;code that must be loaded to $800. So either the loader has to strip the
&gt;first 4 bytes and load the remainder to $800, or you have to load the
&gt;whole file to $7FC so that the STARTUP segment begins at $800.
&gt;
&gt;As you can see, there is no error, anything works as it should. I'm not
&gt;sure why you insist on loading the whole file to $800. If this is based on
&gt;some information in the docs, the docs are wrong. In this case please tell
&gt;me where you found the information so I can fix it.
&gt;
&gt;Older versions of cc65 produced apple2 binaries without the header. It has
&gt;been added later by request of the AppleWin author (Oliver Schmidt). His
&gt;statement was that both, AppleDOS 3.3 and ProDOS are both able to use this
&gt;header.
&gt;
&gt;If you don't want the header, just modify line 3 of the linker config so
&gt;that it reads:
&gt;
&gt;        HEADER: start = $0000, size = $4, file = &quot;&quot;;
&gt;
&gt;This will dump the header by assigning an empty output file. Then apply
&gt;the changed linker config by using
&gt;
&gt;        ld65 -C apple2.cfg ...
&gt;
&gt;instead of
&gt;
&gt;        ld65 -t apple2 ...
&gt;
&gt;The latter command uses the builtin version of the apple2 linker
&gt;configuration as shown above.
&gt;
&gt;Regards
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;        Uz
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
I've a copy of  &quot;Beneath Apple DOS&quot;, in which it describes the binary 
file as having the 4 byte header information, and I at a loss to figure 
out how I originally got it to work.  It might be the a2tools options 
are wrong.  I'll look into that.

CC65 is a great product and I hope to add to your work with the DOS drivers.

Thank you for your help
Jim
