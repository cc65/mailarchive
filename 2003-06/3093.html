&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; While I would say that you're right in most cases, I still don't think
&gt; &gt; it is true for DEVNUM.  Since every file operation changes DEVNUM,
&gt; &gt; programs and utilities for the CBMs do not expect DEVNUM to remain
&gt; &gt; unchanged when a program is run.  And, most C programs cannot be run
&gt; &gt; twice, because static data has changed.
&gt;
&gt; Actually, quite a bunch of tools DO use devnum to find out about the
&gt; last-used drive.  However, the general advice on using these tools is
&gt; &quot;reset -- load -- run&quot; too, so no real need for restoring environment.

Most CBM programs do not talk to the console through files, they use the
Kernal's default channels; and, when a program uses only one peripheral
device, DEVNUM does not change.

The fact that some old programs are badly written should not stop us from
making well-written new programs.  Tools should be easy to use -- and, easy
to re-use.  Not everyone has super-fast loaders :-).  Even when we do have
them, it is easier to re-run a program than it is to reload-and-run it.
(I want that convenience!)

That is why I said, &quot;we should avoid static initializers.&quot;  Even
statically-stored variables, in tools, should have their first values set
dynamically (every time that the program runs).

I am not talking about a programmer's individual code for a specific
program.  I am talking about the &quot;universal&quot; library-code.  It should not
get in the way when programmers do make re-runnable programs.  (The library
already restores other things, such as the stack-pointer, zero-page,
vectors, a scroll-flag, and a margin.)  It takes only a few extra bytes to
restore DEVNUM.  I see no valid reason to leave it out.
