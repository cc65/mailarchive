&gt; &gt; My suggestion would be to ask the following question (in fact, this is the
&gt; &gt; question, I've asked when deciding if a save/restore of other variables is
&gt; &gt; necessary): Is there a need to save and restore this variable? If not, why
&gt; &gt; bother? Or better: Why waste code on it? I've put quite some work in
&gt; &gt; sqeezing out bytes from library functions. Why should we waste code in
&gt; &gt; other areas? IMHO &quot;because there's no reason not do do it&quot; is not a good
&gt; &gt; reason.
&gt;
&gt; indeed. it may look like a good idea at first, but it would just introduce
&gt; bloat to many programs. (i would personally even go one step further and
&gt; remove the cleanup code alltogether and have the program loop infinitely or
&gt; reset at exit like most other c64 programs do).

Not being able to leave a C64 program without a reset was one of the things I
hated most, even in my early C64 days. Most machines don't have a reset
switch, and switching power off and on again will stress the hardware a lot.

&gt; and if you decide that you would like to restore this (and maybe more)
&gt; variables, you can still link some own code to your programs easily and
&gt; without much effort.

One of the most common type of programs on the C64 can be exited without any
effort, namely BASIC programs. This is very convenient and I think it is a
good idea that this will also work with cc65 generated programs.

&gt; just for curiousity...what kind of tool/program is that what you think could
&gt; nead such threatment? and why wouldnt you have it loop infinitely and provide
&gt; an &quot;exit&quot; option rather than restarting it by &quot;run&quot;?

I'm not sure about which treatment you're talking.
