&gt; js&gt; The problem with this solution is that I/O vector area is 'reset'
&gt; js&gt; to 'default', but if there is a cartridge installed which depends
&gt; js&gt; on the I/O vectors 'redirecting', e.g. IDE64, it is snipped off.
&gt; js&gt; My suggestion is to remove the RESTOR call from crt0.s, and
&gt; js&gt; 'restore' only those vectors which are absolutely necessary.
&gt;
&gt; Wouldn't it be more elegant to have the cartridge patch, e.g., the BASIC
&gt; warm-start vector?  That way, the cartridge would restore its needed
&gt; vectors every time it ends up at the ready-prompt.  Or, the NMI vector,
&gt; so you can just hit stop+restore to fix the vectors.  Either way, to me,
&gt; it looks like a problem with the cartridge rather than cc65.

It would not work if those vectors were the ones that had been changed.
Even when it did work, it might destroy daisy-chains of cartridges/wedges.

&gt;
&gt; Calling RESTOR when terminating is a relic from very old versions.
&gt; Since the runtime library doesn't change any of the Kernal vectors,
&gt; it would be OK (and would save 2 bytes) to remove it.

I had been saving and restoring the vectors, in crt0.s; but now, I see that
it makes more sense to do it in a constructor and destructor, on the
occasions when a program actually does change them.

[So ... I _can_ be persuaded to change my mind -- about some things, at
least. ;-)]
