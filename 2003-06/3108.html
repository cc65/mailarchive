&gt; And, I see no reason to restore it, since no one relies on it.
&gt; ...
&gt; My suggestion would be to ask the following question (in fact,
&gt; this is the question, I've asked when deciding if a save/restore
&gt; of other variables is necessary):  Is there a need to save and restore
&gt; this variable?

I rely on it.  (When I write BASIC programs that use more than one drive
[and/or printer], I make those programs remember and restore DEVNUM,
so that I can depend on it being what I expect it to be.)

The IDE64 cartridge is another thing that relies on DEVNUM's value.
We can see a directory-listing simply by typing DIR or LL.  When we do not
type the other parts of those statements, (
    &quot;&quot;,12
for example), they will read from whatever device is &quot;named&quot; by DEVNUM.
I like the convenience of being able to run a program, then afterwards,
display a directory without needing to remember to type the device-number
[but, apparently, no one else likes it :-)].

I will concede that it is not absolutely vital to restore DEVNUM -- unless
you consider convenience to be a necessity [sometimes, I do! :-)].

&gt; If you decide that you would like to restore this (and maybe more)
&gt; variables, you can still link some own code to your programs easily and
&gt; without much effort.

I go further than that.  I changed my copy of the libraries so that they
save-and-restore some useful things that might be trashed.  I mentioned it
to Uz because I thought that other people might appreciate that convenience
as much as I do [if I am wrong, my ego will survive -- just barely ;-)].

&gt; Just for curiousity ... what kind of tool/program is that what you think
&gt; could need such treatment?  And, why wouldn't you have it loop
&gt; infinitely, and provide an &quot;exit&quot; option rather than restarting it
&gt; by &quot;run&quot;?

Suppose I run a program that asks me to type a file-name -- and, I forget
how to spell it (I refuse to admit how often it happens! :-P).  If I am
lucky, then that program has a fancy user-interface, and I can make it show
a directory.  But, what if it cannot do that?  It is nice when I can stop
the program, use a &quot;wedge&quot; to display the directory, re-run that program,
and type the file's name.

&gt; &gt; G&gt; Mmmmh well, are there actually any of these &quot;wedges&quot; that would
&gt; &gt; G&gt; even survive after running a cc65 program?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anything that stays in low mem. ( &lt; $0400, like the tape buffer) and
&gt; &gt; under the Kernal ROM does.  $c000 stuff stands a fair chance of getting
&gt; &gt; nuked though, but that's to be expected.
&gt;
&gt; Well, RAM under Kernal is used by both TGI and also the exp. mem.
&gt; interface.  And, most low mem. can't be used for user programs, either
&gt; (tape buffer being the only practical exception, if and only if
&gt; your cc65 is made to never use tape).

Don't forget that we easily can write and use configuration-scripts that
protect anything that we want to keep in high-RAM.
