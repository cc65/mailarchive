Hello again Rafal,

&gt; &gt; 1. Why do CC65_9X.BAT and CC65_NT.BAT only use relative
&gt; &gt;    paths for CC65_LIB, CC65_INC, PATH?
&gt; 
&gt; READ SETTING_UP.txt
&gt; 
&gt; will be fixed later by additional (somewhat external) small setupping
&gt; program :)

Ok, this was what I wanted. Anyway, can't the installer change this itself?

&gt; &gt; 2. NT.BAT is wrong:
&gt; &gt;    a. use CMD.EXE instead of command.com
&gt; &gt;    b. nt.bat calls NT.BAT; I think it should be
&gt; &gt;         CMD.EXE /K CC65_NT.BAT
&gt; &gt;       shouldn't it?
&gt; 
&gt; isn't CMD here? typo :)

Yes, it isn't here, and you called NT.BAT, not CC65_NT.BAT. This made a
&quot;fine&quot; recursive call.

&gt; IT WORK for 9x as I said in the dox , 9x was succesfully tested ,
&gt; I installed the package few times in different
&gt; places and all was good

Ok, good. Just wanted to make sure.

&gt; &gt; 5. If I added files into the CC65 tree, they are not removed on
&gt; &gt;    uninstalling. You could at least ask for it.
&gt; &gt;    Furthermore, the uninstaller even does not tell me that it did
&gt; &gt;    not remove the directories in this case. I know, this is common
&gt; &gt;    behaviour on Win machines, but despite this, it is not good practice.
&gt; 
&gt; I check if installer support this option

At least a hint that the directory was not removed due to not being empty
would be enough, IMHO.


&gt; &gt; 7. After installing, you want to start \cc65\index.url to go to the
&gt; &gt;    CC65 homepage. At least as guest, this does not work, I get:
&gt; &gt;    &quot;Unable to execute file: c:\cc65\index.url
&gt; &gt;    CreateProcess failed; code 193.
&gt; &gt;    This is due to installing it as guest on my machine. Nevertheless,
&gt; &gt; since
&gt; &gt;    double-clicking on the URL works, the automatic start should work, too.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; in my system it worked

Yes, because you have the right to do so. Anyway, as &quot;guest&quot;, you don't have
much rights. Everything (except that step) works fine, this is something
that is not normal on NT based machines. It would be nice if it would work
this way.

&gt; MANY MANY THANX

You're welcome.

Spiro.
