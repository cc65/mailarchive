&gt; I've started to change the heap using your idea with small modifications;
&gt; but when doing so, I found a few problems.  Maybe you (or someone else)
&gt; can help me solve them.
&gt;
&gt;  1. The suggested solution does not work for configurations where the
&gt;     start-address is passed via the command-line, using %S in the linker
&gt;     config.  Configurations that have this problem are:
&gt;     lunix/osa65 and none.

The LUnix library does not use my idea, anyway.  It is like the GEOS
library:  it does some things differently, so that it can take advantage
of OS features.  It gets its stack and heap from LUnix's dynamic memory.

I do not think that none.cfg's problem is &quot;start=%S&quot; -- at least, not
exactly that.  I think a better description is that the &quot;none&quot; target
must have an open-ended (very loose) nature.  Its purpose is to avoid, as
much as possible, putting built-in restrictions on what we can do with a
program.  But currently, STK's address cannot be set by ld65's
command-line.

I think that it would be useful to many of the targets if you added
another address option:  %S, %E (or maybe, more than two).  They could
be used to change the lower- and upper-bounds of the memory that a program
normally would use (STARTADDRESS would set the standard locations
[maybe it should be &quot;ADDRESS: start=$xxxx, end=$xxxx;&quot; ]).

&gt;
&gt;  2. There are some configurations that do actually cover systems with
&gt;     different amounts of memory available.  One system is the C16 (which
&gt;     supports 16 and 32KB of memory) and the PET, which comes with 4, 8,
&gt;     16 and 32K of memory.  Currently, the startup code determines how
&gt;     much memory is available and adjusts the stack-pointer accordingly.
&gt;     With the old heap routines this worked, since they calculated
&gt;     the heap-end from the stack-pointer.  Using your idea, this does no
&gt;     longer work.  While the old code was not perfect (the linker would
&gt;     not detect a program too large to fit into memory),
&gt;     having 4 different memory configurations just for the PET machines
&gt;     sounds even worse.

After I sent my EMail [naturally, it's always &quot;after&quot; :-( ], I noticed it
in the Apple and Atari start-up files.  I didn't notice those others.

[I really must study all of the start-up files much more! :-) ]

Darn!  I had been _very_ proud of my &quot;invention.&quot;  (I guess that I should
have known -- nothing in life ever truly is perfect.) :-/
I will study the problem.

(I'm thinking out loud, now) ...

We will need to back away from my idea, a little bit -- to gain a
compromise.

(I already did it once, in the stack-checker.  Originally, I made the stack
be an actual, named segment.  And, the low-water mark was built into that
segment's structure.  The checker did not need a constructor.  But, the
LUnix library could not use it.  I remembered that you do not like to see
targets replace common files if they really do not need to do it.  So, I
returned to a design that constructs the mark.  [I now have learned that I
must have been psychic. ;-) Those other targets need that constructor,
too.])

We probably will change __heapend back into a pointer-variable (while
keeping __heaporg as an immediate address).  Then, the problem becomes:
Can we write a constructor (or, constructors) that sets heapend's value
from different sources -- depending on the configuration?  There are two
environments:  pre-set stack and &quot;run-set&quot; stack.

A first -- very crude -- attempt:  move the original constructor out of the
common file, and into files in each target directory.  It would compute
from the stack-pointer, on &quot;run-set&quot; targets.  It would use
__HEAPEND_RUN__, on pre-set targets.  That plan would be compatible; but,
the &quot;run-set&quot; configurations would not be flexible.  (The person who
started this discussion wanted to move the Atari's heap to different
places.)  So, we would need to find a way to let the scripts choose between
the stack and the linker-symbol.

[Of course, those musings come from a person who does not know how you
have changed my original proposal. :-) ]
