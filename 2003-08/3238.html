&gt; While it's OK to have machine-specific stuff, and I've tried to make it
&gt; possible to replace standard files from the cc65 library easily, there is
&gt; one really, really big problem with it: More platform-specific stuff
&gt; means that the sources become much harder to maintain.
&gt; ...
&gt; ...
&gt; ..., and each platform-specific file increases the chance that there will
&gt; be undetected bugs, and that one platform starts to lag behind others.

I really know how right you are about that. :-) But, the urge is difficult
to resist. ;-)

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I think that it would be useful to many of the targets if you added
&gt; &gt; another address option:  %S, %E.  They could be used to change the
&gt; &gt; lower- and upper-bounds of the memory that a program normally would
&gt; &gt; use.
&gt;
&gt; I have to admit that I don't like that idea. It adds a special solution
&gt; for a special problem.  ...
&gt; ...
&gt; Being able to calculate things within a linker-script would solve a lot
&gt; of problems, including the one we have now: One could easily calculate
&gt; the size of the RAM memory-area if the start-address is given,
&gt; so there's no need for %E.

I was thinking of the programmer who might want to steal a region from the
high end of &quot;normal&quot; RAM.  He would need to move the stack out of his way.
(But, he wouldn't need to move the start of his program.)  Without %E, he
would need to write a special script; with %E, he would need only to add an
option to the command-line that builds the program.

I see %E as a natural compliment of %S.  (If a command-line can move the
bottom easily, then it should be able to move the top easily, too.)
I don't see it as a _special_ solution.
