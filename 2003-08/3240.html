Hi!

&gt; I was thinking of the programmer who might want to steal a region from the

&gt; (But, he wouldn't need to move the start of his program.)  Without %E, he
&gt; would need to write a special script; with %E, he would need only to add an
&gt; option to the command-line that builds the program.
&gt;
&gt; I see %E as a natural compliment of %S.  (If a command-line can move the
&gt; bottom easily, then it should be able to move the top easily, too.)

%S is more or less a relict from the old cc65, where the start address could
be specified. None of the existing targets does use it besides &quot;none&quot;, which
is not a real target, and &quot;lunix&quot; where use of %S is not really necessary. So
the argument that we need %E because %S is already there is questionable.

I don't think that we need to protect a cc65 user against using a customized
linker script by any means. Instead of using %S, the standard linker script
could be used and the start address of the segment changed. This is not much
more work than just adding -S to the command line.

&gt; I don't see it as a _special_ solution.

I think it is special. Here is how a more general solution would work (and
this is what I will add when adding expressions to the linker scripts): Allow
to pass arbitrary values from the linker command line into the linker script
by using something like

        --define endaddr=0x2000

The variable could later be accessed as %endaddr in the linker script.

Anyway, I would suggest that we try to leave things as they are now. At some
point in the future, I will add expression evaluation for the linker, which
will solve lots of problems at once without a need for any special solutions.

To solve the heap issue, I will think about moving the heap variable
initialization into the machine specific directories. This would allow
platforms with non contigous memory to use the heap.

Regards


        Uz
