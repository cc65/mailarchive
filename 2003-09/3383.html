well yes ofcoz, but thats no reason not to improve it :=P at this point i am 
wondering that (and why) opt65 doesnt catch this one either ('coz its a 
really simple one) - working on that :=P

&gt; &gt; 2) it maybe a nice possible
&gt; &gt; optimisation to use a branch/increment type of code for the highbyte when
&gt; &gt; adding an unsigned char to an unsigned short.
&gt;
&gt; There is no separate code generation for characters in most cases.
&gt; According to the C rules, for arithmetic operations on integers, the usual
&gt; integer promotions apply, which means that the addition works with
&gt; integers, not with chars. The compiler is not smart enough to find possible
&gt; exceptions. The optimizer will sometimes remove high byte operations, but
&gt; since the compiler doesn't build a parse tree in memory, but generates code
&gt; on the fly, there's no chance to spot this in the parser.

mmmh.... bad :( need to find a solution to teach it to opt65 then :=P (my 
pattern based approach catches it, but due to its brute-force nature its 
kindof slowish :=P)

&gt; &gt; 1) for the heck of it, i cant find out how to make the branch work :=P
&gt; &gt; neither a local label, nor a &quot;*+3&quot; or anything else i could think of
&gt; &gt; would do the trick...any ideas? :) (sth to generate a unique local label
&gt; &gt; could be a solution)
&gt;
&gt; There is no easy way to work around this, and I don't think it's really
&gt; worth the effort.

mmmmh... i've stumbled about a handful cases now where a branch could have 
been really handy.... mmmh. could a possible workaround be using a macro like 
this...

.macro inc_cc foo
	.proc
	bcs @l:
	inc foo
@l:
	.endproc
.endmacro

and then use that in my C inline macro? mmmh..... the question then would be, 
how to include that macro in the generated asm without manually patching it?

whats the problem at this point anyway? i reckon that it does work with a 
local label and with the macro used only once - so is it really just that? 
shouldnt a simple feature to generate unique names for labels solve it then?

&gt; &gt; 2) if any of the arguments passed to the macro are register variables,
&gt; &gt; the resulting code will be all wrong - it generates references to bogus
&gt; &gt; memory locations instead of the register variables :=P
&gt;
&gt; Fixed, thanks!

greaaat.... it'll help a lot with speeding up that thingy :)

&gt; &gt; 1) additional pseudo-variables for the X and Y registers so that kinda
&gt; &gt; macro can be written more efficiantly

&gt; There is simply no way for the compiler to load one register without a high
&gt; chance for using some other. This is the reason why there are no __Y__ and
&gt; __X__ pseudo variables.

mmmmh :(

even something that loads AX with swapped byte order would be cool :=P (coz 
when working with 8.8 fixedpoint, which is pretty common, you often need just 
the highbyte for certain operations - and the optimizer seems to miss the now 
needed ldx/txa sometimes (however it always removes the unneeded lda))

&gt; &gt; 2) i am wondering why the optimizer doesnt change the lda/tay into ldy
&gt;
&gt; Maybe because it's not perfect:-)

must be.... opt65 catches this one fine :o) (and its far from perfect too :=P)

&gt; The use of __AX__ in macros together with the comma operator means that you
&gt; can use this macro in expressions. If you don't do it this way, it will
&gt; also work, but the compiler may not accept the macro in an expression.
&gt; Since all optimzations take place in the back end, removal of unused code
&gt; does not depend on using __AX__ vs. inline assembly.

yeah i noticed that already.... one time it was even smart enough to spot a 
&quot;peephole&quot; in my handwritten asm (shame on me :=P). however my main concern 
was if not using __AX__ could potentially break something, resulting in wrong 
code...

&gt; &gt; - i'd like to page-align some global arrays (since that saves some cycles
&gt; &gt; for free on 0x100 byte tables, avoiding crossing page-boundaries) ... is
&gt; &gt; that possible in C somehow?
&gt;
&gt; Nope.

tjam... it is :o) well not really, but the workaround i am using is like a) 
declare those arrays &quot;const&quot; and b) align the .rodata segment properly - 
works fine so far :) i'd like a somewhat cleaner solution though :=P

&gt; &gt; - how much do the c64 libraries depend on the system interupt, ie $ea31
&gt; &gt; beeing called frequently? will it for example affect the clock() call if
&gt; &gt; i use my own interupt handler? (i'd like to skip the kernel stuff
&gt; &gt; alltogether and just do some simple joystick stuff)...i need a working
&gt; &gt; clock/time for syncing :)
&gt;
&gt; It will affect the clock, the mouse, the rs232 interface and maybe some
&gt; others. You can work around that by not using the mouse, and others and
&gt; updating the clock stuff in your own interrupt handler.

mmmmh.... i'm planning to use the joystick stuff and the clock call, dont 
think i need anything else there.... mmmmh gotta lock at it more closer :)
