&gt; you might want to mention that the ram under the kernal is used for

It's in the graphics driver section, but yes, I can add it also to section 3.

&gt; 4.1
&gt;
&gt; I can't find get_ostype funcref.html
&gt; I can't find cbm_* in funcref.html either

The function reference is incomplete. I've asked for help here in the list,
but I'm still the only one working on it, so it will take some time. Writing
detailed information for all standard C functions plus all platform dependent
functions is a *real* lot of work.

And there seems to be a misunderstanding: I know that the docs are incomplete
with regard to the actual information contained in it. My question was aimed
on the structure, not on the actual content. Once the structure is ok, others
can (and hopefully will) start to use it as a template for the Atari, Apple or
whatever. Missing content can be filled in later without problems, but
starting with a bad structure means that new sections will have to be added
later so the docs will start to differ from platform to platform.

&gt; Some information (or links to information) on how you use the expanded
&gt; memory functions would be nice.

Since the extended memory API is not platform specific, the c64 document is
the wrong place. Yes, it would be nice to have another document describing the
non standard but portable (within cc65) APIs. Most of the functions are
described in the function reference, however.

&gt; And I thought there was a mouse driver?

Yes, but it's not a loadable driver. The idea is to convert all drivers into
loadable ones (which can also get linked statically if required), so I haven't
added a section about statically linked drivers.
