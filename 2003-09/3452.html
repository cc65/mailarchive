&gt; so is there a possibility to make ca65 ouput the &quot;preprocessed&quot; assembler
&gt; code? something like the list-file, but in a format that can be assembled by
&gt; ca65 again?

No, sorry. It is possible but not easy, so in my opinion the effort/usefulness
ratio is too bad.

&gt; tjam, then for a totally different thingy.... a compiler option that would
&gt; make the compiler threat &quot;int&quot; as &quot;signed long&quot; (ie 32 vs 16 bit ints) could
&gt; be really useful when you are porting code and are wondering why the hell it
&gt; doesnt work as intended...if it changes behaviour with 32 bit ints, you know
&gt; whats the problem atleast :=P (no idea how deep the 16bit thing is hardcoded
&gt; into the compiler though, making it an option might be anything from easy to
&gt; impossible depending on the implementation :=P)

Same as above: Possible but too much work just to have a small debugging help.
Problem is that this influences pointer arithmetic as well, because currently
the result of ptr-ptr is an int (which is not standard compliant but ok for a
6502 platform).

&gt; ps...oh and i noticed another thing....on your FAQ page there is a big
&gt; paragraph about the .org directive and the difference between ca65/ld65 and
&gt; other simplier assemblers, but yet it doesnt tell how to exactly &quot;emulate&quot;
&gt; their simplier behaviour (and your suggestion is somewhat misleading too
&gt; IMHO) .... since this is something ppl tend to ask me every now and then, why
&gt; not add this snippet ... :o)

Well, it is my personal opinion that using the emulation features to mimic
other assemblers is a Bad Thing(tm). And your text is rather specific, so I
don't think adding it to the FAQ is a good idea. If I start adding it, I will
also have to add information on how to convert from xa, xasm, acme and all
other assemblers out in the wild.

But how about a new section in the ca65 docs &quot;Porting sources from other
assemblers&quot;? The ca65 docs would be the perfect place for such a text, adding
information about other assemblers is no problem, because there's no reason to
be brief, and I can add a pointer to the FAQ.

&gt; oh and in ca65 docs you suggest using &quot;pc_assignment&quot; for emulating xa65...
&gt; are you sure about this? in TASS (and several crossassembler that are clones
&gt; of it) atleast a programmcounter assignment really moves the programcounter
&gt; (ie, both run AND load address) and not only the (run-)address (eh tricky
&gt; terminology here...so whats the correct term for &quot;the address we are
&gt; assembling to&quot; and &quot;the address we are currently assembling at&quot; ? :=P)

Assignment to PC with &quot;.feature pc_assignment&quot; enabled is the same as using a
.org directive. It may not be the same as a PC assignment in TASM, but it is
rather difficult to mimic every feature in every assembler out there.

&gt; tjam...that reminds me of the &quot;ca65 vs other assemblers&quot; table i have started
&gt; once...maybe i should bring it into a useable state too :=P

How about adding it to the same section in the ca65 docs?

&gt; (can anyone
&gt; recommend a way to layout a large table? its currently in html, but not
&gt; really useful due to its size - lots of scrolling involved etc :/)

Split it into several tables that each have the same layout, but do compare
just one assembler to ca65. This way, we can have a section &quot;Porting sources
from other assemblers&quot;, with one assembler per subsection, and each subsection
can contain such a table. The only problem is that I haven't managed to create
tables using LinuxDoc until now:-(
