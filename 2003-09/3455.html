&gt; Good idea - unfortunately, the HTML files are auto generated, and changing
&gt; the order of the links would mean to mess with the LinuxDoc DTD (I think).

oh...i see. 

(i bet in this particular case one could come up with some fancy 
sed/awk/perl/whatnot oneliner and fix it afterwards :o))

&gt; &gt; mmmmh...apart from that, i noticed there appearently are loadable rs232
&gt; &gt; drivers now?
&gt;
&gt; The swiftlink driver exists but is untested. So I cannot promise that there
&gt; are no more API changes, even if I do not expect anything like that.

ok so maybe i'll wait a bit... is there some app that can be used for testing 
anyway (something trivial i mean, its hard to tell if its really the rs232 
driver when you are testing with contiki :=)) ? would some kind of &quot;mini 
terminal&quot; be useful? (its just about 10 lines of code anyway :=))

&gt; A
&gt; driver for the silversurfer is a good idea, but as far as I remember, your
&gt; driver used polling?

yes it does...however, i dont think its a problem (except that it doesnt allow 
for the full theoretical performance). actually i think that it would be good 
to have both a polling and an irq-driven driver (for my debugging stuff 
anything irq driven is a nono, however for most other cases its probably 
preferred). maybe i'll try my luck with an irq driven driver too sometime...i 
just have no use for it atm :)

&gt; &gt; (i could probably
&gt; &gt; make it work for both silversurfer and ide64 aswell with little work) ...
&gt;
&gt; My experience with loadable drivers is that it is often better to use
&gt; different drivers that work with exactly one piece hardware. It is easier
&gt; to strip the driver down to the really necessary stuff in this case. Since
&gt; programs need to configure the driver anyway, I do even drop any attempt of
&gt; hardware detection. In most cases it is better to save 100 bytes and let
&gt; the user specify which hardware is in place.

mmh well.. actually the only difference is a) the i/o address for the 16c550 
and b) 5 bytes of code to enable the silversurfer :=)

however you have a good point with the hardware detection there.....maybe i 
should make it so two seperate drivers can be assembled from one sourcefile 
(with the tiny differences in .ifdef or sth)... thats how i made it in lunix 
aswell :)

&gt; &gt; also the 4-player joystick drivers, should i clean them up and send em
&gt; &gt; over?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; :=)
&gt;
&gt; Yes, please do so.

ok i'll have a look at them... as far as i remember they where more or less 
finished but need to be made loadable modules.... gotta check that :)
