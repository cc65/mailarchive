&gt; ok so maybe i'll wait a bit... is there some app that can be used for testing
&gt; anyway (something trivial i mean, its hard to tell if its really the rs232
&gt; driver when you are testing with contiki :=)) ? would some kind of &quot;mini
&gt; terminal&quot; be useful? (its just about 10 lines of code anyway :=))

My plan was to use the old uip web server. But I need real hardware for the
test which is the reason, it is not done yet.

&gt; yes it does...however, i dont think its a problem (except that it doesnt allow
&gt; for the full theoretical performance). actually i think that it would be good
&gt; to have both a polling and an irq-driven driver (for my debugging stuff
&gt; anything irq driven is a nono, however for most other cases its probably
&gt; preferred). maybe i'll try my luck with an irq driven driver too sometime...i
&gt; just have no use for it atm :)

I would prefer an interrupt driven driver. But to my suprise, I found that the
silversurfer uses the NMI, not the IRQ line - in my eyes a wrong design
decision, because using the IRQ would have removed a lot of problems with disk
routines and is uncritical for a device that has a 16 byte builtin buffer. So
maybe there's really a use for the polling driver.

&gt; ok i'll have a look at them... as far as i remember they where more or less
&gt; finished but need to be made loadable modules.... gotta check that :)

Please keep in mind that variables must be initialized in INIT, because
otherwise the driver may not work correctly when statically linked.
