Hello ,

Ullrich von Bassewitz wrote:

&gt;&gt;Since this is a console and the program is in ROM, how do I
&gt;&gt;initialize/handle
&gt;&gt;non const global variables?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;You must use different LOAD and RUN addresses and copy the variables from ROM
&gt;into the RAM. For a standard DATA segment, there's a routine named copydata in
&gt;the library which does exactly this - you will have to call it in your startup
&gt;file.
&gt;  
&gt;
Done (shorter than the other version, same linker config).

&gt;&gt;I have 4 linker configuration files for 16, 32, 64, 128kbyte cartridges
&gt;&gt;(64, 128kbyte are bankswitched).
&gt;&gt;Is it allowed to support several supervision targets?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I would prefer not to have more than one builtin config per platform, so you
&gt;will have to choose the most common one. It is not more difficult for a user
&gt;to say &quot;-C sv128.cfg&quot; on the command line instead of &quot;-t sv-128&quot;. The reason
&gt;for the builtin configurations is not to save the user the trouble to use
&gt;configuration files at all.
&gt;  
&gt;
Ok.

&gt;&gt;PS: I attached my work files
&gt;&gt;(how must I deliver/integrate supervision support in cc65?)
&gt;&gt;(some remarks about my first cc65 usage?)
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;[Next time, please place the files somewhere onto a web or ftp server and just
&gt;post a link.]
&gt;
I see it from the point of a modem user who grabs his emails and goes 
offline for reading.
And I thought a 10kbyte attachment is short enough for direct attachment.

&gt;As far as I can see, there are several smaller issues with the files, but
&gt;nothing serious:
&gt;
&gt;  1. Assembler files are named xxx.s, not xxx.asm
&gt;
Done.

&gt;  2. All upper case names are used for #defines, structs shouldn't use it.
&gt;  
&gt;
Ok, switched myself to plain C mode.

&gt;  3. Some stuff is already available in the library and should be reused (like
&gt;     hex2asc).
&gt;
This was in my common.asm for my first assembler based stuff and programs.

&gt;  4. I prefer not to have code commented out. If it is not needed, remove it,
&gt;     if it is needed, enable it. Especially .if/.ifdef is ugly and problematic
&gt;     to maintain, because some code path is not executed and tested when
&gt;     making changes.
&gt;  
&gt;
But sometimes it is needed in my opinion. (I will label some of my .if 
clauses, and removed some code)
Like plain reset/irq/nmi vectors for 16kbyte cartridges and
extended vectors with a short reset routine to activate the correct bank 
before executing
code in the $8000-$bfff area for 32kbyte cartridges.

&gt;  5. Some stuff is targeted for the 2.9 versions and should be adapted to work
&gt;     with the head branch.
&gt;
How do I get access to the cvs tree? (internet address, id, password; 
cvs project name; read only access is ok)?

&gt;  6. Not sure about the functions in common.asm: I don't like the idea to have
&gt;     functions that are similar to the ones from conio but with other names
&gt;     and prototypes.
&gt;
These is my private pure assembler stuff (not to be included in cc65).

&gt;  7. I prefer not to have unneeded types and defines like &quot;byte&quot; and &quot;word&quot;
&gt;     defined in some header file, because this may collide with identifiers
&gt;     used by a program. This is especially true for &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; because
&gt;     for C99 these are even in the standard. In general: Since you are on the
&gt;     &quot;other side&quot; of the code (you are writing an implementation, not a
&gt;     program), please try to be as careful as possible when introducing new
&gt;     types and names: Someone may have a program that does already use the
&gt;     types/names in question.
&gt;
Did a look into the header files. I have been surprised to find some c99 
stuff.
I will use common types, names, defines where possible.
For the supervision code it is enough to work in cc65 in my opinion.
(and I don't expect many libraries to be usable for the supervision).

&gt;  8. A few structural changes to the headers to make them similar to the
&gt;     existing ones would be nice.
&gt;  
&gt;
Added header note.

&gt;Anything mentioned above assumes inclusion into the main cc65 package - if
&gt;you're planing to distribute your files separately, only 5. and maybe 7. is of
&gt;relevance.
&gt;  
&gt;
I don't plan large supervision developements.
It would be nice to have basic supervision support in cc65.

Do you plan to add bit notation support?
&quot;struct { unsigned char bank:3, prescaler:1, lcd_on:1, irq_dma_on:1, 
irq_timer_on:1, nmi_on:1 };&quot;
Do you plan to add optimizations for
&quot;(const?const:const)|(const?const:const)&quot; ?

2nd try at
<a href="http://de.briefcase.yahoo.com/grumpfix/public/sv11.zip">http://de.briefcase.yahoo.com/grumpfix/public/sv11.zip</a>

In my opinion 32kbyte cartridge support buildin would be optimal.
(and please include all 4 config files)
I don't know if there is a good place for stub.s (default starting point 
for assembler users).
I don't know if there is a good place for the technical summary.

Peter
