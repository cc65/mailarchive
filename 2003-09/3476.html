Hi!

&gt; I see it from the point of a modem user who grabs his emails and goes

&gt; And I thought a 10kbyte attachment is short enough for direct attachment.

Each KB distributed via the list becomes more than 100KB when send through the
server. Having small attachments is not really bad, but if most people have no
use for it, it is often better to distribute it by other means. But as long as
you don't append multi megabyte binary patches, things are ok, I think:-)

[.if/.ifdef]
&gt; But sometimes it is needed in my opinion. (I will label some of my .if
&gt; clauses, and removed some code)
&gt; Like plain reset/irq/nmi vectors for 16kbyte cartridges and
&gt; extended vectors with a short reset routine to activate the correct bank
&gt; before executing
&gt; code in the $8000-$bfff area for 32kbyte cartridges.

Yes, sometimes .ifdef is the way to do it. My comments were more targeted on
the &quot;.if 0&quot; in crt0.asm, where the comment states that the code is not needed.

&gt; How do I get access to the cvs tree? (internet address, id, password;
&gt; cvs project name; read only access is ok)?

There are security problems when using readonly access together with
read/write access (at least this was true when I last looked at it), so there
is no public r/o access. For developer r/w access, you do currently need a
static IP address, I will filter access by this address.

If you just need access to the head branch of the last day, you can download
the snapshots from the FTP server.

[common.asm]
&gt; These is my private pure assembler stuff (not to be included in cc65).

Ok, sorry, this wasn't obvious.

&gt; Do you plan to add bit notation support?

Not really, since this can be easily emulated by using bit shifts, and/or the
bit operators. Other things (floats for example) would be more important.

&gt; Do you plan to add optimizations for
&gt; &quot;(const?const:const)|(const?const:const)&quot; ?

This will probably come sooner or later.

&gt; 2nd try at
&gt; <a href="http://de.briefcase.yahoo.com/grumpfix/public/sv11.zip">http://de.briefcase.yahoo.com/grumpfix/public/sv11.zip</a>

&quot;Es ist ein Problem beim Zugriff auf Ihren Account aufgetreten.&quot; :-)

&gt; In my opinion 32kbyte cartridge support buildin would be optimal.
&gt; (and please include all 4 config files)
&gt; I don't know if there is a good place for stub.s (default starting point
&gt; for assembler users).

There's currently no good place for both, I will have to invent something. Any
suggestions are welcome.

&gt; I don't know if there is a good place for the technical summary.

It can go into the platforms specific docs for the machine (maybe with some
adjustments).

Regards


        Uz
