&gt; I would interpret this as if the current behaviour of cc65 is correct. It's
&gt; also easy to remember: Any character or string constant is translated into
&gt; the target character set.

ok, thanx 

&gt; If you don't want the translation, don't use character constants. For
&gt; binary data it is not a good idea to use character constants, why not just
&gt; use numbers:
&gt;
&gt;         printf(&quot;%3d : %3d\n&quot;,010,8);
&gt;
&gt; works as expected.

yesyes.... i just have seen that type of stuff pretty often, mostly in old DOS 
programs :=)

&gt; Not exactly. Two characters of the source character set may be translated
&gt; into the same character of the execution character set. But you check will
&gt; be ok.

so a character does not necessarily have a unique binary representation (more 
than one character may be mapped to the same binary value), right? mmmh... i 
feel like this is problematic... a comment in cq243.c says

&quot; Since the value of a character constant is the numerical value
  of the character in the machine's character set, there should
  be a one-to-one correspondence between characters and values. &quot; 
[note: i think this is founded on the fact that 'a' != 'b' != 'c' etc, it may 
be true only for printable characters?]

however, cc65 passes the test that follows the comment, so maybe the comment
itself isnt 100% accurate either :=P

&gt; The represenation of character like \n depends on the target platform, so a
&gt; check like ('\n' == '\101') depends on the target platform.

mmmh ok. but they are all supposed to be &quot;non printable&quot; (as in isprint()) ?! 
and those *are* supposed to map to unique binary values? or not? :=)
