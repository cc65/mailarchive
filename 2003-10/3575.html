&gt;There is a small error here, the exe header is (FF FF &lt;start address&gt; &lt;end

Ok, I was going from memory, obviously a bad one. :)

&gt;I think this isn't really Atari specific, it should apply to most (all?)
&gt;other targets.

True!  I just wanted to mention it since its one of those things that
could hammer you if you are moving segments around in your linker
config file.


&gt;&gt; That's all I have right now.  I'm wondering if I should talk about how
&gt;&gt; to create a binary file with multiple load segments with cc65 in the
&gt;&gt; binary format section?
&gt;
&gt;Hmm, maybe. Iirc, you need a &quot;hole&quot; inside your program, so multiple load
&gt;segments would be the way to do it. I haven't thought about supporting
&gt;this yet, do you have any suggestion on how to handle it?

I did this in one of my applications that makes use of the extended
memory bank window.  I shuffled the segments around in the linker
config file, and then added a small assembler file to insert another
$FFFF header into the file.  It works great and leaves the $4000-7FFF
window alone, however I had to be careful about how much memory I was
using and where.

I thought that might be too much for a platform specific documentation
file, and perhaps would just be better answered by members of the list
(like y'all did for me) when the question comes up.
