&gt; Anyway, I don't have experience with TAP, ruling out no 2, and I don't have
&gt; experience with anything but Linux, so even no 1 is not very easy to
&gt; accomplish.

the contiki gtk port has the code you want :=) and i am sure adam would gladly
provide you with everything else you'd need.

&gt; I never looked at the rs232 emulation, so I'm not sure if it heavily uses
&gt; Unix features or not. Anyway, there seems not to be much interest of the
&gt; VICE developers in this, thus, it is not taken care of.

the big question is why a non working &quot;feature&quot; is left in the program. if 
noone cares, remove it. (ofcourse making certain visual improvements that
require 2ghz machine are more important, i can understand that :=P)

&gt; Every member of the team implements features for his favourite plattform,
&gt; that is, the one he is using himself. This is only natural. I, for example,
&gt; could not even implement something for BeOS, for example, since I don't
&gt; have this around.

and thats the reason why i refuse to make some of my projects open source
and instead port them to several OSs myself. open development teams that 
dont have a strong leadership and strict rules always end up in producing 
various different versions of the same software.

&gt; &gt; nor about fixing problems that are known for ages (like the rs232
&gt; &gt; emulation beeing broken since vice &gt;1.4, the autostart bugs, the
&gt; &gt; filerequester issues in linux, etcetcetc)...hmpf
&gt;
&gt; BTW: VICE is open source. :-)

open source is not an excuse for releasing crap, thats another common
misbelief :=)

&gt; Which autostart bugs do you mean? AFAIK, they have been fixed some time
&gt; (and releases) ago. If there are other bugs which remain, please make a bug
&gt; report.

x64 -autostart bla.d81

the problem is that the drive doesnt get initialized correctly under certain
conditions.
the fix is to use load&quot;:*&quot;,8,1 instead of load&quot;*&quot;,8,1

&gt; I have heard that there are some RS232 issues, but I don't know exactly
&gt; what they are. 

NMI generated by rs232 freezes the emulator...frequently hitting
&quot;restore&quot; will make the program go on like it should. this bug appeared after
certain other nmi code was &quot;fixed&quot; :=P (not that it was broken before)

&gt; I never heard of filerequester issues in linux. BTW, as

i dont even remember i have to admit, i have not used these filerequester crap
for a while now (someone else told me that one, and he reported it aswell - how
ever its still not fixed in latest release)

&gt; there are different UIs for Linux (xaw, xaw3d, Gnome, ...), which one(s)
&gt; is/are affected?

no fuckin' clue :o) i personally avoid using *nix filerequesters of any sort
since they are mostly unuseable for me (*nix gui developers seem to hate the
term &quot;intuition&quot; :=P)

&gt; Why does everyone think that the VICE developers are all around and look at
&gt; every forum, every IRC chat or the like? 

you should better ask why certain vice developers dont listen to what ppl say
even IF the are around on irc :)

&gt; Even if some do, they do not
&gt; always forward everything to the VICE Developers ML.

that can only be blamed on your lazy developers though :=)

&gt; If you have some bug reports (descriptions how to reproduce would be good),
&gt; feel free to write to vice-devel .at. firenze.linux.it

i have done that once, and got an answer telling me &quot;if you want it fixed, fix
it yourself. noone cares.&quot;. that was my first and last bug report on vice, sorry.
