&gt; &gt; Anyway, I don't have experience with TAP, ruling out no 2, and I don't have
&gt; &gt; experience with anything but Linux, so even no 1 is not very easy to
&gt; &gt; accomplish.
&gt; 
&gt; the contiki gtk port has the code you want :=) and i am sure adam would gladly
&gt; provide you with everything else you'd need.

Spiro and I have actually been in contact quite regularly during his
excellent work with the TFE emulation, and we've just been discussing
porting the TFE emulation to *nix. The problem with the tap device is
that it doesn't exactly provide the same functionality as the pcap
libraries. The tap device basically creates a virtual LAN, while the
pcap gives direct access to the physical LAN (the one on which the PC is
connected to).

Under FreeBSD it might be possible to use the BPF (Berkeley Packet
Filter) to get the same kind of access as the pcap library under
Windows, but I don't know if this is available under Linux.

&gt; &gt; I never looked at the rs232 emulation, so I'm not sure if it heavily uses
&gt; &gt; Unix features or not. Anyway, there seems not to be much interest of the
&gt; &gt; VICE developers in this, thus, it is not taken care of.
&gt; 
&gt; the big question is why a non working &quot;feature&quot; is left in the program. if 
&gt; noone cares, remove it. (ofcourse making certain visual improvements that
&gt; require 2ghz machine are more important, i can understand that :=P)

I sent an email to the vice developers list a few months ago about the
RS232 bug, and got a reply a few hours later with a patch :-) So it
should be fixed in the 1.13 version.

&gt; &gt; there are different UIs for Linux (xaw, xaw3d, Gnome, ...), which one(s)
&gt; &gt; is/are affected?
&gt; 
&gt; no fuckin' clue :o) i personally avoid using *nix filerequesters of any sort
&gt; since they are mostly unuseable for me (*nix gui developers seem to hate the
&gt; term &quot;intuition&quot; :=P)

I think the Gnome version is pretty usable, but the xaw and xaw3d are
simply terrible... I think that most old-school *nix gui developers
actually hate the term &quot;user&quot; ;-)
