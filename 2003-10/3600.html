I am already in contact with Adam.


&gt; the big question is why a non working &quot;feature&quot; is left in the program. if 
&gt; noone cares, remove it.

If it is not fixed immediately, it does not mean it will never be fixed.


&gt; (ofcourse making certain visual improvements that
&gt; require 2ghz machine are more important, i can understand that :=P)

If you would be on the ML, you would see that these visual improvements are
in fact the most wanted features, yes!


&gt; and thats the reason why i refuse to make some of my projects open source
&gt; and instead port them to several OSs myself. open development teams that 
&gt; dont have a strong leadership and strict rules always end up in producing 
&gt; various different versions of the same software.

This means: We should have dropped every architecture which did not support
all features? This means, after 1.13, every non-windows architecture
would've been dropped.


&gt; open source is not an excuse for releasing crap, thats another common
&gt; misbelief :=)

Thanks. It's crap?


&gt; x64 -autostart bla.d81
&gt; 
&gt; the problem is that the drive doesnt get initialized correctly under certain
&gt; conditions.
&gt; the fix is to use load&quot;:*&quot;,8,1 instead of load&quot;*&quot;,8,1

How do you issue a load command if you do an autostart?

&quot;under certain conditions&quot;... Do you have these conditions in a more
specific way? This would help a lot.


&gt; NMI generated by rs232 freezes the emulator...frequently hitting
&gt; &quot;restore&quot; will make the program go on like it should. this bug appeared after
&gt; certain other nmi code was &quot;fixed&quot; :=P (not that it was broken before)

Do you have a working demo?

&gt; i dont even remember i have to admit, i have not used these filerequester crap
&gt; for a while now (someone else told me that one, and he reported it aswell - how
&gt; ever its still not fixed in latest release)

&quot;Someone told me someday that something goes wrong on certain conditions.&quot;

Despite of hearsay, that's a bug report every developer likes!


&gt; no fuckin' clue :o) i personally avoid using *nix filerequesters of any sort
&gt; since they are mostly unuseable for me (*nix gui developers seem to hate the
&gt; term &quot;intuition&quot; :=P)

Where do you find better GUIs?


&gt; you should better ask why certain vice developers dont listen to what ppl say
&gt; even IF the are around on irc :)

If the reports are as specific as the one above, I understand why they don't
listen. :-p


&gt; &gt; Even if some do, they do not
&gt; &gt; always forward everything to the VICE Developers ML.
&gt; 
&gt; that can only be blamed on your lazy developers though :=)

If the bug report is of this big &quot;quality&quot;, why should anyone forward it?
There's almost no chance the bug will be even reproducible.


&gt; i have done that once, and got an answer telling me &quot;if you want it fixed, fix
&gt; it yourself. noone cares.&quot;. that was my first and last bug report on vice, sorry.

Please remember that everyone is doing VICE as a hobby. Furthermore, think
of some of your own comments on some mailing lists, they are not always
polite either.
