&gt; If it is not fixed immediately, it does not mean it will never be fixed.

no, but having a non working feature for *years* and beeing told &quot;noone cares&quot;
pretty much implies it never will be fixed :) having it simply commented out
in the source would make things so much less annoying (for you, the developers,
i wouldnt be complaining :=P).

&gt; If you would be on the ML, you would see that these visual improvements are
&gt; in fact the most wanted features, yes!

i know that this is the case, and thats also one of the reasons why i am not on
this list (i have my &quot;spys&quot; though ;=)). like i said, i understand why you (the
developers) are focussing on these things - but that doesnt mean i have to 
like it.

&gt; This means: We should have dropped every architecture which did not support
&gt; all features? This means, after 1.13, every non-windows architecture
&gt; would've been dropped.

nonsence. no problem if a certain feature gets introduced in one port first and
then gets ported to others over time - however such things should be consistant;
looking at the rs232 again, that wasnt the case for years. thats what i mean
with ppl creating different versions of the same software...ppl start implementing
new stuff in one version, before they have completed porting other stuff from
another version. doesnt make maintaining the source exactly easier either i
suppose.

&gt; &gt; open source is not an excuse for releasing crap, thats another common
&gt; &gt; misbelief :=)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks. It's crap?

i wouldnt say that for the entire emulator package, infact i wouldnt say
that for most of the things in it - but i would lie if i'd say there is
nothing in it that i consider &quot;crap&quot;. things like features that are present
in the gui, but arent functionable are &quot;crap&quot; (they basically shouldnt 
show up anywhere except the development version imho). oh well :)

&gt; &gt; x64 -autostart bla.d81
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; the problem is that the drive doesnt get initialized correctly under
&gt; &gt; certain conditions.
&gt; &gt; the fix is to use load&quot;:*&quot;,8,1 instead of load&quot;*&quot;,8,1
&gt;
&gt; How do you issue a load command if you do an autostart?

1) i mean the load command that vice issues if you are using the autostart
feature. this needs to be changed to load&quot;:*&quot;,8,1 so it doesnt rely on the
precondition of a correctly resetted drive. (this isnt exactly a vice
problem, you get simelar behaviour on a real c64 too - load&quot;*&quot;,8,1 always
loads the *last loaded program* and not the *first program on disc* so 
this may fail if the drive isnt in a proper state. load&quot;:*&quot;,8,1 in turn
will indeed always load the first program on disc, regardles of the 
previous drive status. (note: i think there was another special case on
the dual floppy drives, i dont remember what it was though :P)

2) this is what i use as a workaround:

x64 -8 testsuite.d81 -keybuf &quot;Lo\\22:*\\22,8,1\\0dRu\\0d&quot; 

&gt; &quot;under certain conditions&quot;... Do you have these conditions in a more
&gt; specific way? This would help a lot.

i can only say that it does sometimes work, but most of the time doesnt :)
(various settings may be relevant there, even the rom image used for the
drive)
however, its irrelevant to know - the above fix solves the problem 
alltogether :) like i said, it may not even really be a problem in vice,
since you may get into simelar trouble with a real c64/drive :) (note: on
a real c64 its more unlikely though, since most of the time the drive
will be resetted properly together with the c64)

&gt; &gt; NMI generated by rs232 freezes the emulator...frequently hitting
&gt; &gt; &quot;restore&quot; will make the program go on like it should. this bug appeared
&gt; &gt; after certain other nmi code was &quot;fixed&quot; :=P (not that it was broken
&gt; &gt; before)
&gt;
&gt; Do you have a working demo?

uhm... the contiki rs232 version :=P thats what i last tested it with :) i 
think i have tried novaterm too with simelar results. (you can prolly
hack a small testprog with cc65 easily :=P). if i remember right it even
was enough to enable rs232 in vice, enable nmi from swithlink, and then
send some data to the emu (the first nmi would make vice halt).

&gt; Despite of hearsay, that's a bug report every developer likes!

*G* i know :O) (i wasnt really writing this as a bug report - all these
should be known)

however the bug is that in &quot;attach disc image dialog&quot; (maybe others aswell)
the TAB key will put literal (control-)characters into the textentry fields 
and not jump to next widget as one would expect. (very useful if you have
misplaced your wireless mouse again :=P)

&gt; Where do you find better GUIs?

1) i'm almost under the impression that &quot;any other non *nix system&quot; is the
only answer to that, seen too much *nix programs that would probably be much
more useful if they wouldnt be &quot;gui&quot; programs. (that doesnt mean there arent
any good guis even for *nix, just many programmers seem to have a talent for
choosing the widget library that is most annoying for the user :=) - or, like
adam suggested, they basically hate the term &quot;user&quot; by itself and want them
to suffer while using the program as much as they did while coding it :))
[note: whoever is responsible for placing the &quot;crop to selection&quot; feature in
gimp to where it is should be shot]

2) i personally like the userinterface of ccs64 much more, i dont need a gui 
at all. however if there *is* a gui, it shouldnt be one of those that require
reading a book to be useful. (give yourself a try on using vice without a
mouse once - and dont tell me gui programs dont need to be useable with a
keyboard only :))

&gt; If the reports are as specific as the one above, I understand why they
&gt; don't listen. :-p
[...]
&gt; If the bug report is of this big &quot;quality&quot;, why should anyone forward it?
&gt; There's almost no chance the bug will be even reproducible.

we've been talking to andreas boose for half an hour or so, i'm pretty 
sure that was enough to make clear what exactly the problem is :)

&gt; Please remember that everyone is doing VICE as a hobby. 

ofcourse, however, thats not an excuse either. quit your job, stay up
late - satisfying someone used to scene standards requires more than
just passion. (now dont get me wrong again will ya? :))

&gt; Furthermore, think of some of your own comments on some mailing lists, 
&gt; they are not always polite either.

no, i'm not a big friend of beeing polite for the simple sake of not
making anyone upset. if i think something sucks, i say exactly that.

no offence really, thats just me :)

gpz

ps: as the others....anything further probably better in private mail :)
