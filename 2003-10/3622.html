&gt; &gt; wow....nice one :) all of the tests work again (ie, no more crashes) and
&gt; &gt; additionally 5 of 9 previously failing tests even return the correct
&gt; &gt; result(s) :=) lemme see if i can isolate the remaining problem(s) .... :)
&gt;
&gt; Maybe it's easier if you send me the test code?

hehe well maybe....but i dont mind working it out either :=P thing is that
those tests that contain the bugs atm consist of a relativly large piece
of code (containing a lot of small tests) and they just tell if everything
worked or not, with no chance to see which specific test failed.... and i
am fixing that (a bit atleast :=P) while tracking down those problems :) (i
am planning to use the testsuite on sdcc later, so that kinda features are
needed *casting evil spells on sdcc* :))

however, i'll try to make another &quot;useable&quot; version of the testsuite ASAP so
you can check yourself.... i fixed and extended the &quot;cbmcvt.c&quot; from the 
compiler source aswell (now matches the currently used ascii-&gt;petscii mapping
and can convert in both directions) since using &quot;petcat&quot; in the testsuite
proved to be responsible for some wrongly reported errors. (and ofcourse, the
cbmcvt program is useful not only for the testsuite :=))

&gt; No, I've generated undefined behaviour in the type conversion code. Shame
&gt; on me, I should know - and it was discussed a few months ago in
&gt; de.comp.lang.c: Shifting a variable by the number of bits it has does not
&gt; create zero but is undefined. So
&gt;
&gt;         Expr-&gt;ConstVal |= ((~0L) &lt;&lt; NewBits);
&gt;
&gt; is invalid if NewBits is the number of bits in a long. This is what caused
&gt; the problem.


oh :o) that might be the reason for rotate4.c failing too (wondering whats wrong
with it just right now :=)) ooh... and does it also affects assigning signed chars to 
signed ints? (the test i checked 5 mins ago failed because of a bug in this area)

anyway....more to that later, maybe i'll manage to upload an updated testsuite 
tonite then :)
