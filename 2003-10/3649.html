Hello Ulrich again,

    should i use conio instead of stdio? does that make a difference?
    If yes, it would be really fine. How can avoid using c file io together
with cbm file io, if
    i need cbm load/save routines?
    I didn't want to complain, sorry if this is how you understood that.

&gt; &gt; I see your arguments, but there should be any possibility to find out
which
&gt; &gt; drive has been accessed the last time or something like this, because i
&gt; &gt; don't want to have a program running only on drive 8.
&gt; &gt; The natural thing is, that you use the drive, from where the program has
&gt; &gt; been loaded.
&gt;
&gt; That's ok, but you cannot rely on a compiled program that uses file I/O
not
&gt; touching the kernal variable used for the drive number. Someone suggested
to
&gt; initialize _curunit with the drive number from where the program was
loaded.
&gt; Until this is available, you can use this module to do something similar:
&gt;
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
&gt;        .constructor    saveunit, 32
&gt;   .export _savedunit
&gt; .code
&gt; saveunit:
&gt;      lda $ba
&gt;      sta _savedunit
&gt;      rts
&gt; .bss
&gt; _savedunit: .res 1
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
&gt;
&gt; It is used like this:
&gt;
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
&gt;
&gt; extern unsigned char savedunit;
&gt;
&gt; int main (void)
&gt; {
&gt;     printf (&quot;Saved unit: %d\n&quot;, savedunit);
&gt;     return 0;
&gt; }
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The second thing is, that there are kernal variables $9a/$9b for stdin
&gt; &gt; stdout. This is where the drive
&gt; &gt; output/input device number goes when doing a cmd ... from the c64 basic
&gt; &gt; prompt.
&gt; &gt; So i don't understand why to mess up $ba, which is at the moment the
only
&gt; &gt; possibility to get drive from where the program has been loaded.
&gt;
&gt; The library is &quot;messing&quot; with $ba because it is opening files. And when
doing
&gt; so, it uses the kernal OPEN entry point, which in turn will overwrite the
$ba
&gt; variable. Please note that it is not the library that is overwriting $ba,
it
&gt; is the ROM kernal of the C64!
&gt;
&gt; $9a/9b don't change anything, because stdin and stdout are files and are
&gt; therefore using standard C file handles. Even if $9a/$9b would be used
(which
&gt; is difficult, because the file code is the same for all CBMs and $9a/$9b
are
&gt; C64 specific), stdin/stdout and stderr would still have to be opened. If
you
&gt; don't want the library to open any files, then don't use file I/O - it's
&gt; really simple.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; If there would be another way instead of using kernal variables
directly, i
&gt; &gt; would appreciate.
&gt;
&gt; You do have two choices:
&gt;
&gt;   1. If you want to use kernal file variables without the library messing
with
&gt;      them, don't use file I/O in your program. PLEASE NOTE: This includes
&gt;      printf/fprintf/puts/putc/...
&gt;
&gt;   2. If you find that you need to use C file I/O, you can still use kernal
&gt;      variables, but stop complaining about the library using them, too.
After
&gt;      all, it's your program that is causing the library to do so. Instead,
you
&gt;      will need to understand what the library does and find a way to
cooperate
&gt;      with the library code. One way to do that is shown above. You may run
&gt;      into difficulties with this approach if the library implementation
&gt;      changes. But no one can prevent this.
&gt;
&gt; Above choices are not only limited to cc65, they are - in a similar way -
&gt; inherent in all APIs, where a higher level API uses a lower level one. As
a
&gt; programmer, you should only use one API. If you don't do that, you will
have
&gt; to live with restrictions at best. If you are using C file I/O together
with
&gt; POSIX file I/O under Linux or Windows, you will get unexpected results.
&gt;

&gt;
