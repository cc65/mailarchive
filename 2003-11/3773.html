Hi!

&gt;
&gt; Please note that it is your job to make sure the resulting data is loaded
to
&gt; $5000. Anything the linker will do for you is to relocate the data in the
&gt; segment named &quot;SOUND&quot; to the address $5000 and write it to the given file.
For
&gt; example, if you just have this segment in your config file, and then load
the
&gt; resulting binary to $1000, it won't work. While the linker can prepare the
&gt; data so it is able to run at the given address, it cannot load it to that
&gt; address. The standard setup for the C64 is to load the generated program
at
&gt; $801 (the BASIC start). The linker is used to relocate the data for this
&gt; address, and the startup code will take all necessary steps to initialize
all
&gt; necessary stuff so the program can run. If you want something special
(like
&gt; loading something to $5000), you will have to do that yourself.
&gt;

Aaah, i see.

&gt;
&gt; Is there really a reason to load the data to $5000? If so, you will
probably
&gt; have to use your own linker and startup file, or write the data to a
separate
&gt; file that is loaded from within your program to the this address. While
this
&gt; is possible, I wouldn't suggest this for a first time project, especially
if
&gt; you don't really need it.
&gt;
I don't want to do without music - and Trackers unfortunately don't produce
relocatable assembler source code. But loading within the program was no
problem, so everything works now.
By the way, is there a faster way to load data than using fopen and fread?

Regards,
  Benjamin
