Hi Uz,

&gt; Is an optimizer that has to look forward an unknown number of instructions

&gt; optimizer code is built on this assumption, what if parts of the code
&gt; generator are changed later? And what about inline assembly?

Ok, I have not though about inline assembly. Anyway, from remembering
your previous posts, I had the impression that cc65 does *not* heavily
reuse registers, so I assumed that something like this is not possible.
Obviously, you know the code much better than me, and I have to admit
that my only try to write and maintain a compiler has been many years
before and it never come to the state to be usable, so I cannot tell
about implied complexities to this.

And: No, I don't think ignoring such a problem is good practice!


From your statement, I assume that cc65 optimizes on the assembly code
itself, not on any type of intermediate code? From my rememberings of
compiler writing, a coverage analysis (which was told as being always
done) tells me when a value is surely not needed anymore, and such an
analysis would be done even for register contents in the optimization
state (well, I must admit that I think this was told in university, but
I'm not sure 100%). This information would be sufficient, but from your
statement, I assume this information is not available, is it?

&gt; &gt; Is this sequence only occurring while using shifts, or are there other
&gt; &gt; circumstances that may lead to these?
&gt; 
&gt; As far as I can say it is only occuring for right shifts by 8 bits, and in
&gt; addition to that, the left operand must be a global variable. The pattern for
&gt; locals looks different as well as the pattern for anything else as the left
&gt; operand.

Well, this surely is an argument not to put to much effort for
optimizing this very rare case. As I told above, ignoring possible
problems is not a solution, and I'm sure anyone ever hit by a compiler 
error due to optimization and having to debug much code until he looks
at the generated output, will have the same opinion.

Later,
   Spiro.
