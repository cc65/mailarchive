&gt;
&gt;I haven't looked further into the issue, but it's probably not a good idea to
&gt;add the latter to the dio api. dio was made to allow low level (not file
&gt;oriented) disk i/o. The function could be made apple2 specific, however.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
I only suggested the dio namespace as apple has 2 functions that 
read/write a block of data.

&gt;&gt;I am looking for a status of what's been done and if we're even
&gt;&gt;compatible.  Oliver might be working on ProDOS 16 implementation where
&gt;&gt;I'm working in ProDOS 8.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Does this mean there are several different file I/O libraries needed for the
&gt;Apple? If so, would it be possible to find a common denominator for all of
&gt;them?
&gt;  
&gt;
A little history (as I understand it)- you can skip if you heard it.

1st &quot;dos&quot; on apple was a 13-sector solution that was called DOS 3.2. A 
firmware upgrade converted the 13-sector encoding into 16-sectors which 
is known as DOS 3.3.  Apple rewrote DOS to provide support for hard 
drives and called it ProDOS, which is known as ProDOS 8 as it can run on 
most Apple II hardware.  The IIGS which is an extentsion of the line 
used the 65816 processor and ProDOS 16.  The GS also has GS/OS which is 
very MAC like.

I have a GS but I never got into the GS/OS stuff, so I don't know it 
well at all - I am assuming that most people will want either a DOS 3.3 
or ProDOS 8 library as those two options will cover 80% of the machines 
(??).

ProDOS 8 interface is real easy to work with, set up a structure with 
the info and call the main routine.  DOS 3.3 is harder - you have to 
fill in objects inside DOS and call a couple of routines.

Long story short - there is not too much that is common - most of the 
code is setting up the function call.

&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm not too sure what you mean by this.  Functionally ? Internal
&gt;&gt;structure ? Syntax ?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I'm trying to keep the overall design consistent. This extends into several
&gt;areas, internal structure is one of them. Portability is another: Anything
&gt;that could be done in a portable way, shouldn't have a platform specific
&gt;solution. If it is not possible to make something completely portable, it is
&gt;often possible to split it into a platform independent part and a platform
&gt;dependent one. I'm trying to make the platform independent part as large as
&gt;possible (share as much code among the platforms as possible), because this is
&gt;easier to test and to maintain.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;For example: I've coded the Apple libraries to correspond with the POSIX
&gt;&gt;calls
&gt;&gt;int chdir(const char* path);
&gt;&gt;int __fastcall__ close(int fd);
&gt;&gt;int creat(const char *name, mode_t mode);
&gt;&gt;int flush (int fd);
&gt;&gt; ... and so on ...
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Good approach, this is how it should be! However, there's at least one
&gt;problem: The library does already have a chdir function in the common
&gt;(platform independent) part. It calls a platform specific function named
&gt;__syschdir which must return a platform specific error code in A (similar to
&gt;remove(), which calls __sysremove).
&gt;
&gt;As you can see from the above, I'm trying to get overall structure right, so
&gt;the parts and platform code fit together nicely.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
Ah !  I get it.  I didn't see the __sysremove call.

&gt;&gt;The hacks in the write and read functions have been worked with so that
&gt;&gt;using the STDIO consts work.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Great! This is how it should work. Does reopening these streams also work?
&gt;
&gt;        freopen (stdout, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;output.txt&quot;);
&gt;
&gt;A perfect solution would even allow to close and reopen the low level file
&gt;descriptors (STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO and STDERR_FILENO), and reopen them
&gt;pointing to a file. This is difficult on some platforms, and not implemented
&gt;everywhere, so don't bother if you have hardcoded checks for the standard file
&gt;descriptors (which means that reassigning them will not work).
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
I don't allow the STDIO to be remapped - it's possible.  How should the 
tty be represented ?
&quot;/dev/tty&quot; ?  I don't want to make a Apple II Unix with dev inodes and 
such on the disk -  the disks are too small for standard Apple II's.  I 
can see using /dev/tty and /dev/stty0, ...
Cygwin uses &quot;CONIN$&quot; &quot;CONOUT$&quot;

There has to be some way to allow the code to select the &quot;right&quot; device 
on reading or writing.  Which leads to a device table.
devices:
console (r/w)
serial (r/w)
parallel (r/w)
disk(r/w)
joystick(r)
clock ?

Would it be possible to implement the new loadable driver idea with the 
disk ?  The console routines would be an easy extension - the functions 
would always point to ROM or library functions.


Thanks

&gt;If you're doing larger changes/additions, I would suggest to check back with
&gt;me early. It is frustrating if you have spent several weekends to code the
&gt;ultimate cc65 addition, just to have me reject it for some reasons you didn't
&gt;know when you started. Or, request large changes. And, believe me, having to
&gt;do this is also very frustrating for me!
&gt;
&gt;I'm glad about every cc65 contribution. But I do also want to keep cc65 clean
&gt;and consistent. It wouldn't be helpful to accept contributions just to be
&gt;polite, even if they do not fit into the overall concept or if there are some
&gt;other reasons, they shouldn't go into the main distribution. This would
&gt;ultimately make cc65 a mess. Checking back with me early helps to resolve any
&gt;problems that might arise with a contribution and therefore reduce the
&gt;frustration for both of us.
&gt;
&gt;Regards
&gt;
