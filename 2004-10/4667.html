&gt; But the circle does not seem to have any kind of hardware support on any

Hardware support has never been a reason for adding something to a TGI driver
(or not). Most platforms don't have any hardware support for graphics at all,
so if this would be required, the TGI API would consist of nothing but loading
and unloading a driver:-)

One serious problem is the code overhead involved when calling tgi_setpixel.
So most primitives have to go into the driver, because implementing them
externally by repeated calls to tgi_setpixel will make them too slow. In
addition, the video memory configuration for common platforms does allow for
some optimizations, which means that not all address calculations have to be
repeated when steping from one to the next pixel. For example, implementing
the tgi_circle routine in C would be at least 3 times slower than the current
implementation in the C64 driver. Most other 6502 platforms with a simple
graphics chip are comparable in this respect, so honouring your request and
moving circle support out of the driver would have a serious performance
impact.

When developing TGI, I planned to &quot;steal&quot; an idea from the Borland BGI
interface: emulation. A BGI driver is not required to implement several high
level functions, ellipse and bar among them. If the function is not available
in the driver, the BGI library will emulate these routines outside the driver
by calling device independent routines that themselves call simpler driver
functions (like setpixel, line, or whatever). In early times of the TGI
interface, there was emulation for the BAR routine as a test case. I removed
it and required all drivers to implement BAR natively, because it proved to
have mostly disadvantages: Since the program does not know if the driver, that
will be loaded at runtime, will have support for the emulated routines, it
must link code for these routines to the executable. This will add several KB
to the program (and we're talking about platforms with an average of 32K
available RAM for programs!). Even a naive implementation of BAR, CIRCLE or
whatever in the driver itself, will always be faster and smaller than the same
code outside the driver. This is the reason why CIRCLE, BAR and friends are
required in todays TGI specification.

I would suggest to add a simple circle implementation to the driver. Just make
it work, no need to make it fast. If no one uses it, there's no problem with a
slow implementation. If people use it and feel it is too slow, someone will
hopefully come up with faster code. That's the advantage of open source:-)

&gt; I would like to see a filled triangle there instead of the circle. A
&gt; filled triangle can be generated by the Lynx hardware from a pixel that is
&gt; tilted and stretched by the hardware.

No specification is perfect, and the TGI API was crafted for platforms without
hardware acceleration in mind. In these cases (which cover ALL existing
platforms besides the Lynx), drawing triangles is rather slow, so there was no
need for this primitive. I admit that this is a drawback for the Lynx, but
there's no way to make something fit for everyone.

&gt; Another curiosity is the text. I don't believe that the text should be in
&gt; the tgi-library.

As with circle, practical purposes where the reason for implementing text.
Most graphical programs want to plot text somewhere on the screen. And,
implementing text outside of the driver would mean that the font would not
match the screen resolution, and plotting would be slow like hell, because
pixel for pixel has to be set by calls to tgi_setpixel. Many platforms are
able to implement text quite somewhat faster, at least if the text is aligned
to text coordinates. This was the reason for moving text output into the
driver. I can see that there are no advantages for the Lynx, but this is
different for many other platforms.

In general, there's always some personal taste involved in these decisions, so
I don't claim that my decisions are perfect. But for most existing platforms
they are ok, I think. Just assume, the TGI specs would have been crafted with
your suggestions in mind. That is, triangles instead if circle, and text
rendered by the high level API. This would be quite a performance hit for all
other platforms. Circles - which are used much more likely than triangles -
are several times slower, text is even more slower, and triangles are also
slow, because they have to be rendered by the CPU. Because triangles are not
used very often, but are implemented in the driver, we will also end up with
larger programs.

So please do not judge what has to go into the driver from just looking at the
Lynx. In fact, the Lynx is quite untypical. It would be nice to have special
Lynx features supported, but improving the situation for the Lynx while at the
same time worsening the situation for all other platforms is not the way to
go.

&gt; For a system like Lynx I would like to create a text
&gt; font. But it should be usable by the text tools like console I/O.

Most other systems do have something like &quot;text mode&quot; (for some, it's the only
mode supported). &quot;Text mode&quot; is usually different from graphics mode. So both
things are implement differently. I know that there are some platforms, where
text mode is just emulated (the system is actually running in graphics mode
all the time), but this is not the rule.

To solve most of your problems, I would suggest to implement the required
functions in the driver, so people can use it, and otherwise ressort to the
tgi_ioctl call to implement Lynx specifics. I'm sorry that this is a bit
awkward, but I see no better way, if we want to keep support for other
platforms as good as it is.

Maybe we can come up with a few common driver extensions (like triangle) and
move a few ioctls into the TGI header file. So we would have

    1. the definitive TGI API using the tgi_... functions,

    2. some optional functions implemented using tgi_ioctl. These functions
       should behave nearly identical when implemented; necessary definitions
       will go into the TGI header file. And

    3. a set of platform or driver specific functions. Definitions for these
       functions should go into the platform header file.
   
This approach wouldn't require a change of the API, while at the same time
allowing Lynx programs to use the special features of the hardware (at the
expense of portability).
