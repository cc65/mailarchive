<a name="start" accesskey="j" id="start"></a>Hi Uz,

&gt; It's the compiler which has some ugly stuff in it. Casting pointers to longs
&gt; and encoding them into an array of bytes for example. This one the reason for
&gt; the problems on some 64 bit platforms. Most of the other stuff should be ok.
&gt;  
Oh yes, that sounds pretty nasty... :-)
No, I'm only joking, I haven't got your experience, I'm just getting 
back into C programming now, although I've done a fair bit of OO 
programming (and also 6502 and x86, but that's quite long ago). But I 
noticed I couldn't compile your code on my AMD64 platform. It just 
bombed out on some table, which I couldn't quite understand.

&gt; The exact wording is: &quot;It is highly portable.  The only unportable part is the
&gt; table itself; all real code goes into the common library.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; This means: The table itself is platform dependent. There's one table for the
&gt; CBMs (because they share PETSCII as charset), there another table for the
&gt; Atari, one for the Apple, and so on. The code that works with the table (like
&gt; isupper(), isalpha()) is the same for all platforms.
Ok yes, well, that was probably quite a dumb question :-)
Somehow I never associated portability with a pure data table before. If 
a piece of code is portable, it works with on a number of platforms, 
with a number of different compilers - these are given from the outside. 
But your table is interpreted by your own code, which you can change.
But then again, perhaps I'm thinking too much... :-)

&gt;&gt;(I'm hereby reactivating my alias, I always thought it was too short,
&gt;&gt;but then seeing your 2-letter one, I guess it's not that bad :-)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Uz&quot; is not really an alias, it's a nick. My parents first planned to name me
&gt; this way, but later decided it may give problems, so they named me &quot;Ullrich&quot;,
&gt; but called me &quot;Uz&quot;. I've been called this way since my birth. There are some
&gt; records[*] that were taken when I was between 1 and 2 years old. My my
&gt; grandfather was reading a book with me. And he was already calling me &quot;Uz&quot;.

That's quite interesting, I always love these little things :-)
I had a similar problem with my first name. I wish parents would think a 
bit before they paste these name inventions on their children who have 
to run around all their life with them producing no end of unforseen 
complications.

In your case for example (I'm guessing you grew up in Germany) Uz was 
pronounced Utz. But now in english you're Uzzz - they've turned you into 
a bee!!!

But of course you also got what is probably the shortest (quasi-)alias 
in existence. And as we well know, in Unix everything shorter is also 
much cooler...

All the best,

kol


&gt;
