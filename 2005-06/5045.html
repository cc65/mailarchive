<a name="start" accesskey="j" id="start"></a>Good morning to you and thanks for the response.

I don't know if you will get two copies of this or just one, I just got 
your email about messages deleted with too much quoted material, so, 
just to be on the safe side I thought I would delete more quoted 
material and re-send the message.  I apologize if you get two copies. 
of the message, but based on the reminder email I wasn't sure you would 
get one.  I will be more careful in the future, thanks for 
understanding, all your time and hard work is much appreciated.

My questions ---

When I install the 2.10.1 version and then assemble  using ca65 and 
link using ld65 the linker will locate the include files just fine with 
no additional intervention from me.

When I install the 2.10.5 (20053005) version using the same method as I 
used for 2.10.1, I find that ld65 doesn't locate the include files, and 
I must use the -I PATH option to inform the linker where the include 
files are located.

I'm using Mac OS X 10.3.7 and both versions seem to install just fine, 
except for the one difficulty with the include file path in the linker.

What I am curious about, is, is there something different about the way 
2.10.5 finds or where it expects the include files to be that is 
different from 2.10.1?  If there is a difference, maybe I can modify 
what I am doing to take it into account.

BTW:  I use Fink (a great open source program) to install and manage 
applications such as cc65 on my system.  There are scripts that someone 
else made, such as the ones made by the Fink maintainer of cc65 for the 
Fink project.  Fink will allow one to download and install fresh 
sources, or keep sources on the local computer for installation.  I do 
both for various open source programs I have installed on my system, 
for cc65 I keep my sources local to my computer.

I'm still working my way through understanding some of the other 
difficulties I am having with using cc65, and I will try to ask more 
detailed questions when I understand more.

I believe that the difficulties I am having are in the way I am doing 
things, I am just trying to understand what is happening so I can 
modify what I am doing to make things work correctly.  Mostly cc65 is 
working just great, there are just a few little kinks that I need to 
work out.

Uz -- Thanks for such a great complier, and thanks for your time and 
help, it is much appreciated.

Later,

Andy

&gt; Without more detailed knowledge, it is difficult, to say something 
&gt; about it.
&gt; Under Windows for example, you need to set the CC65_INC environment 
&gt; variable.
