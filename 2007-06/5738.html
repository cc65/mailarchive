&gt;&gt; Thus - making the rpm or deb target install into /usr (even if I am
&gt;&gt; not fan of it unless the package becomes part of the global
&gt;&gt; distribution) does not disturb that own builds from the sources may
&gt;&gt; still install into /usr/local. In some cases I'd even say that it
&gt;&gt; properly complements.
&gt;
&gt; The reason for installing in /usr/local is to distinguish &quot;local&quot;  
&gt; files from
&gt; &quot;official&quot; ones. With the availability of package management  
&gt; systems like rpm
&gt; or deb, this distinction is no longer necessary:

Yes and no. Please take the general example that I gave in the  
previous post.

&gt; The package manager can
&gt; always tell, which package a file belongs to and who built the  
&gt; package.
&gt; Dependencies make sure that a packages cannot be installed if the  
&gt; necessary
&gt; prerequisites aren't matched. Instead of installing into /usr/ 
&gt; local, my
&gt; suggestion is therefore to build and install packages.

If someone wants it that way - sure! But... we are talking about RPM  
now. How about PKG, DEB, SIS, INST and, and...? Thus, unless someone  
does all the work to allow easy building of packages for all the  
supported systems - building binaries from sources is much more  
&quot;safe&quot; option. BTW. I usually do my builds into &quot;local&quot; also because  
overwriting something at the &quot;global&quot; level is easy, while returning  
to the earlier stage in such case is much more difficult.

&gt; This is in fact what I
&gt; do with foreign software. I don't know about .deb files, but  
&gt; building RPMs is
&gt; rather easy, and it enables me to remove ALL files that are part of an
&gt; application suite, even after a year or so, when I have forgotten  
&gt; about it.

Again - take the generic example I gave in the previous post. There  
are cases where it is much safer or even desired to keep the &quot;local&quot;  
version separate.

&gt; Regarding the default setting in the master makefile: I'm not using  
&gt; it to
&gt; build the RPM packages. So I can live easily with /usr/local as  
&gt; default if
&gt; this is the wish of the majority. On the other side, changing a  
&gt; line in the
&gt; makefile or calling make with &quot;prefix=/usr/local&quot; on the command  
&gt; line is not
&gt; what I would call a real effort, so I don't see it as a big issue.

It's not a big issue but... once I occasionally forget about doing  
it, because practically all other builds install into local - I end  
up with a situation, which is clearly bad. Manual cleaning (and being  
sure that nothing gets omitted/overwritten/deleted) is an additional,  
unnecessary and error prone work.

And last but not least that manual change requires (at least required  
not that long ago) also adding CC65_INC=/usr/local/lib/cc65/include  
CC65_LIB=/usr/local/lib/cc65/lib to the envars. Another thing that is  
quite uncommon and easily gets forgotten. Then, only after digging up  
the reasons for something not working, it comes back to mind.

Please don't get me wrong - we are talking about actually a minor  
change that IMHO makes the situation much more comfortable for (I  
presume) most people willing to build from sources, while not doing  
any harm to people willing to install from RPM.

1. default &quot;prefix&quot; to be /usr/local
2. taking care of the LIB and INC paths at the Makefile/build level

With best regards.
