No problem. Others may be glad about 32-bit packages.

&gt; &gt; Is there a way to check
&gt; &gt; which packages are available without going through all the apt hassle? A
&gt; &gt; simple directory listing with download facility would have saved me 15 minutes
&gt; &gt; of work.
&gt;
&gt; Well, <a href="http://debian.trikaliotis.net/dists/stable/Release">http://debian.trikaliotis.net/dists/stable/Release</a> shows that I
&gt; only have i386 architecture.
&gt;
&gt; This is also backed up by
&gt; <a href="http://debian.trikaliotis.net/dists/stable/contrib/">http://debian.trikaliotis.net/dists/stable/contrib/</a>, which only shows a
&gt; binary-i386 directory.

Knowing of and checking these files needs intimate knowledge about the
structure of .debs and .deb repositories, which I currently don't have. So I
hoped for something more obvious. This is my &quot;use Spiros repository&quot; story:

  * Add the repo line to the package manager. Which complained, because the
    repo wasn't trusted.

  * So I tried to add the signature. Found that gnupg does no longer work,
    because the new version on Ubuntu goes via the proxy, which isn't allowed
    port 11357 (PGP keyfetch) outbound.

  * Tried to change the firewall setup using fwbuilder from my old Centos
    installation. Which did not work, because a chrooted environment cannot
    access the X display.

  * Installed fwbuilder on the new Ubuntu machine.

  * Tried to load the old config. Fwbuilder version is now 3.0 instead of 2.x,
    which means I have to upgrade my firewall config. I hope, nothing went
    wrong.

  * Just to be sure, I tried the old config checking &quot;use as temporary but
    don't store&quot;, so if something goes wrong, I'm back to the old config with
    a reboot. But uploading won't work, because fwbuilder tries to write to
    /etc/tmp on the firewall, which does not exist and cannot be easily
    created, because /etc is a readonly file system on flash.

  * After some fiddling, I find that the problem persists only if &quot;use as
    temporary but don't store&quot; is checked, so I try the old config without and
    it works.

  * Added a firewall rule allowing the proxy port 11357 outbound for PGP key
    fetch. Compiled and installed the new firewall rules.

  * Trying to read key 2AF47E44 as root as described on Spiros page does not
    work, because root doesn't have a PGP setup.

  * Checking PGP as normal user, it says, key 2AF47E44 cannot be found on
    wwwkeys.ch.pgp.net. So I'm trying a few other key servers. Found the key
    on wwwkeys.pgp.net.

  * Loaded the key and exported it into a text file.

  * Imported the key as root into apt.

  * Restarted the package manager. This time I was able to download the
    package list from the repo.

  * Checked &quot;cc65&quot; and tried to install.

You may imagine that I was a little bit frustrated that after all this hassle
the repo didn't have the packages I wanted. Having an easily accessible list
of packages, or the PGP key as a downloadable file would have saved me quite
some trouble. Of course none of the stuff described above was useless. Being
able to edit the firewall config or download PGP keys is necessary, but I
didn't expect having to do it now.

Just out of curiosity: Sites like rpmforge offer RPM files both for browsing
and download and as a repository that can be added to yum. Isn't that possible
with .deb repositories?

Regards


        Uz
