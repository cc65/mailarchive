&gt; I'm not sure what type of comments you're actually looking for,
&gt; however here's some nitpicking:

Maybe I should explain, how it came to this text:

I get a handful of requests a year from people planing to port cc65 to new
systems and asking for more information. There is currently no document that
describes how to do a port. Bruce offered to write such a document using his
target as an example. It was my request to have the text be as generic as
possible, so it is useful for a larger audience.

&gt; These three lines initialize the external (global) and system
&gt; variables. It should be noted that for very simple embedded systems,
&gt; these lines could be deleted and the program would still function
&gt; correctly; however, the user must be extremely careful since none of
&gt; the variables will be initialized (all variables – local and global –
&gt; must be set to a value prior to use) and the heap will not be usable
&gt; (no calls to malloc () can occur).

I don't know if a note like this is really a good idea, because not having
variables initialized with zero violates an important part of the C standard.

Regarding the initlib/donelib stuff: The original document written by Bruce
didn't have these calls. It was my suggestion to add them, because they're
necessary for anything more complex and I thought it would be a good idea to
have the document cover more than just a specific case to be as useful as
possible.

&gt; ...isn't that great because the author obviously hasn't asserted that
&gt; no part of the supervision.lib he uses is actually relying on these
&gt; three lines.

Even if he had, that could easily change with a new release.

&gt; On the other hand I'd have expected a section saying that a 'JSR
&gt; donelib' right before a 'BRK' could most likely be deleted, but there
&gt; wasn't.

Yes, maybe. But as it is documented now, it covers the general case and that's
good for the reasons named above. Having calls to zerobss and initlib/donelib
is always correct and does always work. Leaving them off, may work for a
specific system and for a specific version of the library.

&gt; On the other hand I'd have expected a section saying that a 'JSR
&gt; donelib' right before a 'BRK' could most likely be deleted, but there
&gt; wasn't.

Yes, I've thought about that myself. But the line does no harm, and since you
don't know, what a constructor may alter, it's a good idea to have it in
there.

Someone fighting with memory problems may think about that different, but as a
guide for porting cc65 it's much better to show the correct way that does
always work.

Regards
