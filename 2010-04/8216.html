&gt; and then some (long) time later i decided to write my own
&gt; kernel from scratch  &lt;snip&gt;  infact the only thing my &quot;os&quot;
&gt; currently cant do that lunix can is networking, everything else
&gt; works more or less.

Well good sir, why aren't we all using Groenix by now?  I'd like to
give it a whirl myself.  Are your libraries re-entrant?


&gt; &gt; ... I don't think it would be too difficult to
&gt; &gt; come up with libraries that were re-entrant AND could be used
&gt; &gt; efficiently by programs that don't care about other tasks.  But
&gt; &gt; then ...
&gt;
&gt; the problem is, that currently, with non-reentrant runtime, the
&gt; library can cheat a lot at various places, and by that reduce
&gt; codesize (and increase speed) quite a bit. i wouldnt want to
&gt; miss that for code that doesnt require reentrant libs (which
&gt; also is the common case). but indeed, i wouldnt mind reentrant
&gt; libs as an option :)

A fully capable paged memory extension cartridge would REALLY
come in handy for keeping re-entrant libraries fast.  But I
haven't built that quite yet, have I?

I'm curious how much of a speed difference there would be.  I
think I would probably start with a fully reentrant library,
then come up with single-thread versions of just those
functions that could really benefit.

Then I'm not sure if it would be the application's choice on
which to use, or more of a configuration preference of the
user.  If a (well-behaved) app was built against the ST library
and had a fully compatible MT version substituted, it shouldn't
do much more than slow it down.  If you go the other way, then
you'd have a program blocking that didn't expect to.

But then there's the careful use of CS and other semaphores.
If the O/S has good cooperative support, how much would you
REALLY need re-entrant code?  Most non-reentrant calls are
short enough that other processes can block w/o causing
problems.  Those that tie up shared memory for a long time
perhaps wouldn't gain much from all the shortcuts.

I'm really anxious to be working on these issues.  I can only
go so far without actually trying to implement the stuff.
