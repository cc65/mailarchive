&gt;&gt; Here's an example of a typical usage in the player state-machine:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; state := *+1
&gt;&gt;     jmp (states)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     single_page 5*2
&gt;&gt; states:
&gt;&gt; st_dead = &lt;*
&gt;&gt;     .word do_nothing
&gt;&gt; st_walk = &lt;*
&gt;&gt;     .word do_walk
&gt;&gt; st_jump = &lt;*
&gt;&gt;     .word do_jump
&gt;&gt; st_crawl = &lt;*
&gt;&gt;     .word do_crawl
&gt;&gt; st_climb = &lt;*
&gt;&gt;     .word do_climb
&gt;
&gt; Are you sure this table must be within a single page? A can only see a
&gt; requirement for word alignment, caused by the 6502 bug in conjunction with the
&gt; indirect jmp.

Sorry, I should have made it clear that I'm treating &quot;state&quot; as a
single-byte variable (hence the LSB operator for the state constants.)
Mostly I need to avoid page-crossings in jump tables like these, data
indexed through self-modifying code and in timing-sensitive cases
where I can't afford cycle penalties.

&gt; You can also combine this with single segments for each table and place them
&gt; into their own memory area. This allows you to move the tables around without
&gt; touching the code when the linker notifies you about a page cross.

That sounds like a reasonable approach to me. Then I can even reorder
the tables to minimize alignment losses.

&gt; A memory area that contains aligned segments needs itself an alignment that is
&gt; at least as large as the largest alignment of the segments contained within.
&gt; The alignment is not forced on each fragment, just on the sections (= part of
&gt; a segment that comes from one object file). This could be improved but is the
&gt; current state.

I'll be careful with segment alignment then ;)

&gt; The macro looks like it should work with ca65. Can you show me one that
&gt; doesn't work? I have had cases where it is better to split up a macro into two
&gt; or three to make it clean and working.

Right, that's the version I eventually got working by making the macro
tail-recursive. Before that I tried recursing from within an if-branch
and hit a sixteen level nesting limit. I didn't mean to submit a bug
report or anything, I just wanted your take on whether I was abusing
the assembler in a way likely to get me into trouble.

&gt;&gt; Oh, and I realize that you're swamped with feature requests but better
&gt;&gt; error messages for macro expansions would be really nice.
&gt;
&gt; I know that, but thanks anyway:-) If it were easy to do I would have added it
&gt; already. So I cannot promise anything.

I wouldn't be averse to implementing this feature myself and
submitting a patch, especially as the code looks surprisingly clean
and readable to me. How would you prefer to see it handled?

&gt;&gt; Also an alternative macro pseudo-op (say .xmac) with pre-evaluated
&gt;&gt; parameters (or perhaps a per-argument operator) would be great as it's
&gt;&gt; awfully easy to forget to parenthesize expressions. I suppose I should
&gt;&gt; be used to this from all those years of writing C code but I still
&gt;&gt; managed to get bitten in that interleave macro ;)
&gt;
&gt; You can already emulate that by using a wrapper macro and/or local symbols for
&gt; evaluation. And once you are familiar with it, it is no longer a problem:-)

I suppose you're right, and at least I don't have to worry about
expressions with side-effects.
