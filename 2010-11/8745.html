&gt;      [snip]
&gt;  What that means is that you have to add necessary headers yourself. . . .
&gt;  . . this is easier than you think...

My point here is twofold.  I rely on the ability to quickly write
some assembly code and very easily assemble, load and run it.  I
don't see that going away any time soon, no matter how powerful my
development tools are.

And more importantly, every other assembler I know of for the C64
can generate a loadable binary file from a single assembler source
file with relative ease.  In fact, this is the norm from all I have
seen.  When someone discovers ca65 and decides to try it out for the
first time, I would think this is most likely the first thing they
would attempt.  It's such a common and fundamental model that it
seems there should be a quick and simple way to do, and not involve
a lot of research.

Recently a friend of mine spent many hours over the course of 2 days
trying to get a trivial bit of assembler code to just build with
ca65.  I had already been using cc65 for a few months at that point,
and I wasn't able to offer much help, even after spending hours
reading and experimenting.  I wonder how many other people have had
the same experience and ended up writing ca65 off as being
complicated or unintuitive.  This would be a shame.  I think that to
reasonably expect folks to be able to adopt ca65 for anything other
than augmenting cc65 C code requires that a new user could easily
figure out how to do what is one of the simplest things on all the other
assemblers he's used.  Am I alone in this thought?

That said, I completely understand the scarcity of time.  It just
struck me as something that would easily trip up a new user.
Anyway, I'll take a stab at it and go from there.
