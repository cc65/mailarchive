I don't in any way mean to suggest that anything be dumbed down, or
to let platform-specific stuff creep into the core tool-chain.  My
working assertion is more like-- &quot;Make the tool flexible enough
that you can readily create convenient customizations for any
individual platform&quot;.  cc65 is made that way I think, for the most
part.

&gt;         .word *+2       ; start address
&gt;
&gt;         lda #&lt;hello_txt
&gt;         ldy #&gt;hello_txt
&gt;         jsr $ab1e
&gt;         rts
&gt;   hello_txt:
&gt;         .asciiz &quot;HELLO&quot;

Hmmm... A simple hack, that prepends what amounts to a &quot;file format&quot;
detail to the code.  As hacks go, this isn't a huge deal because
it's small enough, and once you know the trick it's not too much to
swallow.

But the implication of this hack in the bigger picture sends chills
up and down my spine, and I think it's important enough of an issue
to give it some thought.

It would be one thing if you could specify the load address of the
actual first code byte and specify that the &quot;header&quot; segment be
positioned to butt up to it.  But having to specify the load address
as 2 bytes lower, where nothing will really be loaded, is IMO ugly.
The BASIC stub header seems a little less offensive because it's
kind of hidden alongside the stub code, which you don't really need
to analyze to get what it does.  (Or, you THINK  you don't need to.)

But, in fact, one thing that kept me confused about how the config
files actually worked is that the *default* start address for the
&quot;RAM&quot; area is specified an $07FF.  The actual start of the BASIC
RAM area is really $0801, so what is it really trying to do?  I had
a nagging distrust of those values, and it led me to do nutty things
like trying to position things at a +2 offset in that region and
try changing the memory area start address(es), etc. to try to get
my programs to work.  (Of course, that only broke it further....)
Only yesterday did I discover what it was really there for after
Groepaz directed me to look at crt0.s in the cc65 source.

I don't want to go into huge detail in the list at this point, but
I think that the load address &quot;header&quot; should perhaps be part of a
file format specification.  Those 2 bytes should in no way disrupt
the correct specification of either a memeory area or where the code
segment is actually going to be loaded.

I'm not pushing this as something that really needs to happen soon,
but if there are those who would like to toss the idea around, I
created a wiki page (basically intended to be temporary).  That OK Uz?
<a href="http://wiki.cc65.org/doku.php?id=output_file_format_talk">http://wiki.cc65.org/doku.php?id=output_file_format_talk</a>

&gt;  That &quot;technique&quot; above *is* documented under the headline `Porting
&gt;  sources from other assemblers &lt;<a href="http://www.cc65.org/doc/ca65-17.html">http://www.cc65.org/doc/ca65-17.html</a>&gt;`_
&gt;  in the ca65 documentation.

Indeed it is.  Thanks for pointing it out.  Perhaps I missed that
because it's mostly explained under the heading &quot;TASS&quot;, which I have
never used.
