<a name="start" accesskey="j" id="start"></a>Hi,

If you're maintaining a cc65 TGI driver please read on...

Quite some months ago we were discussing here improvements for the TGI
color handling. We reached some good results - however most of them
were not actually implemented. Therefore I revisited the topic.

First let me briefly summarize our results:

1. We aggreed on that there is no benefit in using the same color
macros (i.e. COLOR_RED) for both conio and TGI. On the other hand
there might be targets that benefit from having different color values
for conio and TGI. Therefore we aggreed to introduce additional color
macros for TGI (i.e. TGI_COLOR_RED). The documentation is already
adjusted but there no TGI_COLOR_... macros whatsoever in the target
header files!

2. We aggreed that we live with the somewhat inconsistent usage of the
TGI_COLOR_... macros in the TGI API. As long as one doesn't modify the
default palette the macros can be used in the calls
tgi_setcolor/tgi_getcolor/tgi_getpixel just as expected. When is comes
however to palette manipulation the macros rather mean the palette
index of the color in question. For example after a tgi_getpalette one
can replace red with a different color with
mypalette[TGI_COLOR_RED]=... This means that the values of the macros
_MUST_ be in the range of 0..tgi_getmaxcolor. And this especially
means that the values for monochrome graphics must be 0 and 1 as those
have two palette entries.

3. We aggreed that the TGI_COLOR_... macros are defined in the target
header files thus allowing the targets to define them differently
(just like the COLOR_... macros for conio). However _ALL_ TGI drivers
for a single target need to share the TGI_COLOR... macros. This
requirement might very well mean that TGI drivers are required to
convert color values at runtime. Here's a hypothetical example:

A certain target has two TGI drivers. One for a monochrome mode and
one for a 16-color mode. Because of the usage of the TGI_COLOR_...
macros as palette indices it is obligaroty to have
#define TGI_COLOR_BLACK 0
#define TGI_COLOR_WHITE 1
for the monochrome mode (see 2. above). But the 16-color mode needs
white to have the value $0F. Then the 16-color mode TGI driver needs
to convert (remap) the color values in order to allow TGI_COLOR_WHITE
to be used. This conversion is not only necessary for
tgi_setcolor/tgi_getcolor/tgi_getpixel but _ALSO_ for
tgi_setpalette/tgi_getpalette/tgi_getdefpalette where the second index
needs to be the one that shows as white in the default palette.

4. According to my records/memory we didn't discuss the actual palette
values. However the overall goal of cc65 TGI is to allow for
target-independent graphics programming and from that perspective i is
obligatory that the TGI_COLOR_... macros can be used as palette values
too. This means that a TGI_COLOR_... macro can serve three (!)
purposes:
- A &quot;simple&quot; color for tgi_setcolor/tgi_getcolor/tgi_getpixel
- A palette index corresponding to that color in the default palette
- A palette value

Only if we follow these rules one can write things like:
mypalette = {TGI_COLOR_RED, TGI_COLOR_BLUE};
mypalette[TGI_COLOR_WHITE] = TGI_COLOR_GREEN;

One implication of the these rules is btw. that _ALL_ default palettes
consist the ascending values in the range of 0..tgi_getmaxcolor.

So far so good - I've been looking through the cc65 source code in
order to see what needs to be done to actually realize the above:

- All targets without any TGI drivers don't need any TGI_COLOR_...
macros - a no-brainer.

- 'c64' has only a monochrome mode driver. So the (black/white = 0/1)
rules above apply. It has a palette so additional color macros are
useful. As far as I understand the values are identical to the conio
values so I defined the TGI_COLOR_... macros to be identical to the
TGI_COLOR_... macros. Please speak up if this is wrong and needs to be
changed!

- 'c128' has only monochrome mode drivers. So the (black/white = 0/1)
rules above apply. They have palettes so additional color macros are
useful. As far as I understand the values are identical to the conio
values so I defined the TGI_COLOR_... macros to be identical to the
TGI_COLOR_... macros. Please speak up if this is wrong and needs to be
changed! However the default palette contains as second value $0F (not
1) so there is some work in the drivers necessary - which I can't do.

- 'lynx' has only a 16-color mode driver. So the (black/white = 0/1)
rules do _NOT_ above apply. In fact white has the value $0F so this
target benefits from the target-specific TGI_COLOR_... macros. I
defined the 16 macros to be identical to the TGI_COLOR_... macros.
Please speak up if this is wrong and needs to be changed! However the
default palette has totally different values than the TGI_COLOR_...
macros - they even seem to be 16-bit values so there is some work in
the drivers necessary - which I can't do.

- 'atmos' has only a monochrome mode driver. So the (black/white =
0/1) rules above apply. It has a palette so addional color macros are
useful. However currently white has the value 7 (not 1). So here a
runtime conversion/mapping is necessary - which I can't do.

- 'atari' has 5 monochrome mode drivers. So the (black/white = 0/1)
rules above apply. Given the generic driver architecture I don't
understand it but I'm pretty sure that most TGI drivers do need
conversion/mapping. As there not only monochrome and 16-color drivers
but addionally 4-color and 9-color drivers the conversion/mapping has
to take those into account as well. The colors used by the 4-color
drivers have to be in the range 0..3 and the 9-color driver colors
have to be 0..8 - which I can't do.

- 'apple2[enh]' has an 8-color and 16-color mode driver. So the
(black/white = 0/1) rules do _NOT_ above apply. However the 16-color
mode driver needs does need conversion/mapping to use the same color
values the 8-color driver uses. I'll take care of that.

As Uz already pointed out today the TGI kernel needs the value of
TGI_COLOR_WHITE as it sets the current color to white on tgi_init().
Therefore every target has to provide the TGI kernel with that value.
Uz provided my with the concept of doing so and I'll take care of that
pretty soon.

Regards,
Oliver
