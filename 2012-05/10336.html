&gt; and i still wonder... WHY? at least two implementations are available (one
&gt; from greg if i recall correctly, the other from myself). what the hell is
&gt; wrong with them? =P

The one from Greg doesn't only implement open-/read-/closedir, but does also
completely change the syntax of file names, implements stat and friends,
rewind and other stuff, changes things that Greg didn't like in many different
places (comments, function declarations with unnecessary __fastcall__, types
in function declarations, ...) and more. The stuff Greg sent me has a total
size of &gt; 90KB.

There's nothing to say against implementing stat or whatever. I would also
happily apply patches that fix typos in comments and improve their wording
(I'm not a native english speaker after all). But I want these patches broken
down and one by one. I'm not going to apply a monster patch that changes 10
different things at once and that I'm not able to grasp within a reasonable
time. In the given case, I had also decided against changing file name syntax
earlier, so if I have only one big chunk with completely rewritten file name
parsing, it won't get applied.

Don't get me wrong, Greg is a genius, and I appreciate, what he is doing. But
he has the tendency to mix up lots of different things in his patches. Just
the diffs(!) to implement a clock() function for the Lynx had more than 90 KB.
To get this in relation: The complete source code of the Lynx specific library
is just 80KB!  After my complaints he was fortunately able to strip it down to
a 3.5 KB patch, which I happily applied.

When it was in this stage, I had already forgotten the link you posted, so
I decided to do it myself, stopped somewhere in between, and managed to
somehow loose the sources, as I found out now when looking for them.

So it's not bad will on my side, just an unfortunate coincidence.

I might start over with your C module, but as you probably know it is not
usable as is and will need some work.
