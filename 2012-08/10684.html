<a name="start" accesskey="j" id="start"></a>Hi,

As threatened I'd like to disuss the options for &quot;uniform mass storage
device discovery and file locations&quot;. Unfortunately this is - at least
from my perspective - more complex because it's about several
scenarios and cross-target...

1.
The first scenario I have in mind is again the editor that is about to
save the content to disk. I believe one could do that in a meaningful
still portable (meaning not only cc65 cross-target) way:

- Ask the user for the &quot;File Location&quot;
- Ask the user for the &quot;File Name&quot;
- Save the current location using getcwd()
- Set the location entered by the user using chdir()
- Open the name entered by the user using open()
- Restore the current location using chdir()

This is not just replacing one string with two strings. For me it
means to recognize that there are basically to ways to deal with file
locations. One could classify them as in-band and out-of-band. A
system that has pathnames follows the in-band approach (i.e. &quot;modern&quot;
OSes, Apple II ProDOS). A system that works with devices, slots,
drives beside filenames follows the out-of-band approach (i.e. CBM
DOS, Apple II DOS 3.3).

I think by decribing a file as a string tuple that can be fed into
chdir() and open() we can archive a harmonized view on in-band and
out-of-band and still have two goodies
- Full POSIX portability
- A meaningful UI
Again: From my perspective what the user enters as file location is
totally different on the different targets - and this is good because
the typical usecase isn't a user operating a single cc65 program on
different targets but rather a user operating different programs on a
single target.

Additionally the use of a specific function for setting the file
location - chdir() - possibly opens up the option to support CBM DOS
extensions for subdirectories, because that function knows that it is
fed with a file location (and not a filename) and is therefore
supposed to do local processing - in contrast to open().

2.
The second scenario I have in mind is a program that discovers and
displays the name of all files currently available in the system. This
could be a demo program coming with cc65 and could be the base on
which cc65 programs are build programs that allow users to handle
files in a menu driven style (like CBM-Command / A2Command). In my
opinion one should be able to write such a program in a cc65
cross-targe style - while surely using cc65-specific stuff.

Let's pretend for a moment that we have only one device/drive but a
hierarchical filesystem. Then we could something like this:

showdir(char *n) {
    char o[PATH_MAX];
    DIR* d;
    struct dirent* e;

    getcwd(o, sizeof(o));
    chdir(n);

    d = opendir(&quot;.&quot;);
    while (e = readdir(d)) {
        printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, e-&gt;d_name);
        if (_DE_ISDIR(e-&gt;d_type))
            showdir(e-&gt;d_name);
    }
    closedir(d);

    chdir(o);
}

There are a few things to note about this code:
- It uses opendir() always with &quot;.&quot; (it especially doesn't make the
presumption that opendir() can take the same argument as chdir()).
- It doesn't presume it can traverse upwards using &quot;..&quot;.
- It presumes only two things regarding chdir()
  - A relative traverse into a subdirectory is possible by using a
directory entry as-is (similar to what we want from open())
  - What getcwd() delivers can be used for chdir() and reverts the
state to that of the getcwd()
- It doesn't make any presumptions on the directory path syntax
(especially no presumption on a path separator)

Maybe I'm naive but with this coding style it should be possible to
support CBM DOS extensions with subdirectories - as there's no
presumption made how the syntax looks like. Looking at our scenario
1.) above it would still be desireable to use something user-friendly.

So far so good (hopefully) ... but where does the parameter for the
initial call to showdir come from? Here we need some cc65-specific yet
cross-target stuff:

The first question to answer seems to me: Do we want to enumerate
devices/drives (even if they are empty) or do we want to enumerate
disks/volumes present? I don't know enough of the other targets but if
possible I'd argue for the former, simply because it's more powerful.
A program like CBM-Command should be able to list all drives present
and denote them with &quot;&lt;empty&gt;&quot; where appropriate. For Apple II ProDOS
I can say it is possible.

Presuming we're enumerating devices/drives the next question is if
they are identified by numbers or strings. I personally tend towards
strings but I'm open. However whatever we come up with it would be
very desirable to have dio_open() use the very same thing. Afaik
currently only the Apple II and the Atari implement DIO so that
shouldn't be an issue. BTW: DIO for the CBMs &quot;should&quot; be implemented
allowing i.e. programs like CBM-Command to transfer between disk image
files and real disks in a cross-target manner.

So if we distinguish between devices/drives and disks/volumes there
needs to be some function to get from the former to the latter. This
may seem superfluous from the CBM perspective but i.e. Apple II ProDOS
uses volume names to access files so one needs to learn the volume
name of the disk in a certain drive in order to be able to access
files &quot;by drive specification&quot;.

Given the fact that the only guaranteed usecase of the return value of
the function in question is to be a parameter to chdir() I called the
function I implemented on the Apple II just rootdir(). I'm however
open to change that for a common cross-target name. If a device/drive
is empty rootdir() fails. Otherwise its result can be fed into
something like showdir() above.

BTW: <a href="http://wiki.cc65.org/doku.php?id=cc65:apple2:files">http://wiki.cc65.org/doku.php?id=cc65:apple2:files</a> is such a
program for the Apple II that I'd like to turn into a cross-target
program to put into th cc65 samples directory.

So far my thoughs on the topic,
Oliver
