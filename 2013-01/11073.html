&gt;
&gt; Well-written programs may as well check for the C flag on return;
&gt; which is a sort of convention with many KERNAL routines.
&gt; Unfortunately, somebody &quot;forgot&quot; to add this to, e. g., OPEN call.

Are you talking about the Kernal's function or BASIC's OPEN statement? 
(The Kernal's OPEN does set the Carry flag; and, BASIC does check it.)

&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I suspect that you had not seen that command-channel behavior
&gt;&gt; before now because you always had done that tradition -- before now.
&gt;
&gt; You are very much right! But, there were also reasons for that. First,
&gt; back in the days I had one drive; and, if someone had two, he was
&gt; perceived as someone who doesn't know what to do with money. ;-)
&gt; This means I didn't really care about how many files I keep open
&gt; because the drive itself limited me more than anything else. Second
&gt; is that programming in a single-task environment didn't call for
&gt; releasing
&gt; resources ASAP. This came to me later. Today, a) being well used to
&gt; immediate release of resources, and b) having to deal at the same time
&gt; with three (each different) drives, uIEC, IDE64 (with two filesystems
&gt; mounted) means that keeping command channel open for all of them
&gt; (yes -- that's the case here) leaves hardly any room for actual data
&gt; files
&gt; being open on them.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway -- this is quite OT here.

It actually isn't Off-Topic.  People who want to deal with many drives and
many files, as you did -- but, in C -- will need to know that CC65's CBM
library does what I described:  When the first file, on a particular mass
storage unit, is openned, the library opens a status file, too.  It keeps
that status file open until all files, on that unit, have been closed.  The
library does that separately for each unit!  The ROM KERNAL has a limit of
10 open files; but, CC65's CBM library has a limit of 8!  And, that count 
can
include stdin, stdout, and stderr.
