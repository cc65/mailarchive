&gt;&gt; I have similar feelings as Spiro. If the c64 platform is changed, it doesn't
&gt;&gt; make sense to bank out just the kernal. Banking out I/O also is not much
&gt;&gt; worse, but has the advantage of giving linear memory.
&gt; 
&gt; I see. My reading on C64 memory layout options didn't reveal that
&gt; option. Otherwise I'd probably proposed it in the first place.

On a 64 banking out the I/O is usually done as &quot;last resort&quot; when running out of mem, therefore it didn't strike me that you were not proposing it as first thing to do. But for a compiled programs it may well be the case.

&gt;&gt; Almost no code written by cc65 beginners will work. What I have seen from
&gt;&gt; posts here and in the web, people start using short programs which increment
&gt;&gt; $D020 or call BSOUT via inline assembler, either because they come from BASIC
&gt;&gt; or from assembler. And none of this stuff will work any more.
&gt; 
&gt; If these programs are what you measure cc65 against then this is of
&gt; course a showstopper.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; In addition, programs will get larger and slower.
&gt; 
&gt; Many features of the runtime / C library make programs larger. I.e.
&gt; being able to access both the screen and the disk with write() is an
&gt; overhead as many programs use it only for one or the other task. So
&gt; I'd say that the fact that programs get larger is by itself no
&gt; argument. It's always the question of the overhead related to the
&gt; benefit. Otherwise there would be no need for cc65 and everybody would
&gt; code everything in assembler as it gives smaller programs.
&gt; 
&gt; Regarding speed I'd like to learn about _meaningful_ scenarios which
&gt; would suffer in a noticable way. Maybe I'm naive but nevertheless...
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; While I agree that having the option of a banked out kernal is an advantage
&gt;&gt; for some programs, it has no advantages for most programs and disantages for
&gt;&gt; many.
&gt; 
&gt; Again one needs to additionally assess how much &quot;the many&quot; programs
&gt; suffer and how much &quot;the few&quot; programs benefit to turn this raw fact
&gt; into a meaningful argument.

I'd rather say that it is more important who the actual target is. For small programs, the final size of a compiled binary is usually plainly repulsive when compared to few lines of assembler that would achieve the same thing. So - when the target audience are the &quot;beginners&quot; then it would hurt more than give benefits. When we talk about serious usage though - every bit of RAM you can squeeze out may be a godsend, when RAM starts to be precious.

&gt;&gt; Maybe the best approach would be a separate library as with the C16/Plus4:
&gt;&gt; They're in fact the same platform, but the C16 has the kernal in place, while
&gt;&gt; the Plus4 banks it out. But this would of course mean a separate platform
&gt;&gt; library to maintain.
&gt; 
&gt; Mayby that's at least partly a question of how this is set up. The
&gt; various CBM targets have a lot of code actually duplicated. This
&gt; causes of course quite some (unnecessary) effort. The approach taken
&gt; for apple2 / apple2enh causes in contrast rather moderate effort...
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway I don't believe that there's a momentum to change the exsisting
&gt; c64 target so the question is if linear RAM up to $FFF9 is worth the
&gt; effort to create an maintain an additional target.

Depends on how it is done. I personally would like to see the possibility of using all the RAM that can be used. But I also have to agree that it would be good to find a compromise that would not repulse someone who writes the hello.c to see how the compiler works (before getting on to something more serious) and after seeing 22KiB of binary as a result of one printf() just simply gives up. [*]

If it can be done in a way that would allow to minimise the effort (maybe even optimise other cbm targets on the way?), then it would be clearly a good thing to me. ... my $0.03.
