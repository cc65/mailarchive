<a name="start" accesskey="j" id="start"></a>Hi,

&gt; i'd simply not use any program not giving me this kind of info. (and
&gt; a progress indicator is not important at all. if it takes longer than about 25
&gt; seconds, i wont use the program either. basicaly anything direct disk access
&gt; using kernal is mostly an academical excercise for the same reason - a program
&gt; ment to be actually used would come with its own turbo-dos anyway =P)

Surely - but I'm afraid we're missing the point totally with this discussion:

Imagine a &quot;Hello World&quot; sample program which needs C library support
to write to the screen. You deny this need with the argument, that it
is an academical exercise to use a C compiler with a C library just to
write &quot;Hello World&quot; to the screen. Got the point?

&gt;&gt; If I understand you correctly then dio_phys_to_log() and dio_log_to_phys()
&gt;&gt; are the very mappers you're asking for.
&gt;
&gt; but these are provided by the library, not the application, right? meaning the
&gt; application must come with all possible tables (of which most would never be
&gt; used).

You totally lost me here. Maybe you want to elaborate what usecase
you're talking about and what tables you're thinking of.

&gt;&gt; An implementation supporting just the 1541 would already be WAY better than
&gt;&gt; no implementation at all. From the little I understand about CBM drives I
&gt;&gt; believe that supporting the 1541, 1571 and 1581 would both be feasable and
&gt;&gt; cover many usecases so it might be the sweetspot.
&gt;
&gt; then you have a c64 library.

I'm totally fine with that.

&gt; for cbm you'd atleast have to support 8050,8250
&gt; as well. and maybe also sfd-1000. and dont forget the code to detect the
&gt; drives (which is far from trivial to do reliably)

Okay, than it's C64 only, no problem with me.

&gt; 1541 only would be especially pointless - because for that drive all kinds of
&gt; imagineable tools exist already (and better/faster than you could ever do with
&gt; cc65's kernal stuff). i would actually ignore 1541 completely for these
&gt; considerations and try to find out what makes sense for other drives first -
&gt; since those could actually benefit from newly written programs.

1. In my first post I was talking about the usecase of a WGET and an
FTP program. Do they already exist? Do they have IPv6 support - or
will have soon? Do they work with multiple Ethernet hardware using
loadable drivers?

2. In general there &quot;exist already&quot; &quot;much fast/better&quot; computers than
the C64. Therefore it doesn't &quot;make sense&quot; at all to write new
programs for them. It's just &quot;especially pointless&quot;. ;-))

Regards,
Oliver
